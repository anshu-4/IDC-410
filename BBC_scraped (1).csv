27,Middle East,https://bbc.com/news/world/middle_east,[],"The rights group Amnesty International is calling on the Tunisian authorities to halt the prosecution of blogger Emna Chergui, whose trial is set to begin on Thursday.

The 27-year-old blogger is being prosecuted for sharing a satirical post about coronavirus on her social media account that looks like a verse from Islam’s holy book, the Koran.

If convicted, Ms Chergui could face a prison sentence of up to three years.

Imitating a Koranic text is considered a violation of something that is deemed to be sacred.

The image, which was reportedly designed and originally shared by an Algerian atheist who lives in France, contains text that says the virus came from China and tells people to wash their hands.

In a statement, Amnesty's North Africa director Amna Guellali said the right to freedom of expression extended to what “some might consider shocking or offensive”.

She called on the Tunisian government to amend the law ""so they are compliant with human rights"".

In early May, when the post was first shared during the fasting month of Ramadan and while the country was still largely under lockdown, it caused a stir online.

The head of one political party condemned it without naming her, saying the state had a duty to protect what was sacred in the same way it did to prohibit apostasy and incitement to hatred - but he called for a punishment other than imprisonment.

68,Coronavirus cure: When will we have a drug to treat it?,https://bbc.com/news/health-52354520,"['James Gallagher', 'Health', 'Science Correspondent']","Image copyright Getty Images

More than 350,000 people have died with Covid-19, but there are still no drugs proven to help doctors treat the disease.

So how far are we from these life-saving medicines?

What work is being done to find treatments?

More than 150 different drugs are being researched around the world. Most are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has launched the Solidarity trial aimed at assessing the most promising treatments

The UK says its Recovery trial is the the world's biggest, with more than 5,000 patients already taking part

And multiple research centres around the world are attempting to use survivors' blood as a treatment

What types of drugs might work?

There are three broad approaches being investigated:

Antiviral drugs that directly affect the coronavirus's ability to thrive inside the body

Drugs that can calm the immune system - patients become seriously ill when their immune system overreacts and starts causing collateral damage to the body

Antibodies, either from survivors' blood or made in a lab, that can attack the virus

What is the most promising coronavirus drug?

The latest clinical trials of remdesivir, an antiviral drug originally developed to treat Ebola, have been encouraging.

The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) found that remdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days down to 11. The trials involved 1,063 people at hospitals around the world. Some were given the drug and others were given a placebo (dummy) treatment.

Dr Anthony Fauci, who runs NIAID, said: ""We now have solid data showing that remdesivir diminishes to a modest degree the time to recovery for people hospitalised with COVID-19.""

However, although remdesivir may aid recovery - and possibly stop people having to be treated in intensive care - the trials did not give any clear indication whether it can prevent deaths from coronavirus.

It is thought that antivirals may be more effective in the early stages, and immune drugs later in the disease.

The UK government has made the drug available on the NHS, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying it was the biggest step forward in terms of treatment since the pandemic began.

UK regulators say there is enough evidence to approve its use.

It is one of the four drugs in the WHO Solidarity trial and its manufacturer, Gilead, is also organising trials.

The US data on remdesivir was published at the same time as a trial of the same drug in China, reported in the Lancet medical journal, showed it was ineffective.

However, that trial was incomplete because the success of lockdown in Wuhan meant doctors ran out of patients.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

Can HIV drugs treat coronavirus?

There has been much talk, but little evidence, that a pair of HIV drugs - lopinavir and ritonavir - would be effective at treating coronavirus.

There has been some evidence they can work in the laboratory, but studies in people have been disappointing.

The combination did not improve recovery, reduce deaths or lower levels of the virus in patients with serious Covid-19.

However, as the trial was conducted with extremely sick patients (nearly a quarter died) it may have been too late in the infection for the drugs to work.

Can malaria drugs stop coronavirus?

Malaria drugs are part of both the Solidarity and Recovery trials.

Chloroquine, and a related derivative, hydroxychloroquine, may have antiviral and immune-calming properties.

The drugs have been thrust into the spotlight as potential coronavirus therapies, largely because of claims made by President Trump, but there is still scant evidence on their effectiveness.

Hydroxychloroquine is also used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, because it can help regulate the immune system.

Early laboratory tests have shown it can inhibit the coronavirus, but there are growing concerns about its use against the disease.

The WHO recently suspended its global trials of hydroxychloroquine following a large-scale study in the Lancet. That found the drug's use can cause heart problems, and actually increased the likelihood of death.

The WHO says there is no definitive evidence of its effectiveness.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference?

What about immune drugs?

If the immune system overreacts to the virus then it can cause inflammation throughout the body. This is helpful for rallying the immune system to fight the infection, but too much can cause collateral damage to the body and can be fatal.

The Solidarity trial is investigating interferon beta, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis, and lowers inflammation. Interferons are a group of chemicals released by the body when under attack by a virus.

The UK's Recovery trial is investigating dexamethasone - a type of steroid used to reduce inflammation.

Can survivors' blood treat coronavirus?

People who survive an infection should have antibodies in their blood that can attack the virus.

The idea is you take the blood plasma (the part which contains the antibodies) and give that to a sick patient as a therapy.

The US has already treated 500 patients with what's known as ""convalescent plasma"", and other countries are getting involved too.

How long until we have a cure?

It is too soon to know when we might have a drug that can treat the coronavirus.

However, we should start to get the results of trials in the next few months. This is much earlier than we will know if a vaccine (which protects against infection rather than treat it) is effective.

This is because doctors are testing drugs that have already been developed and are known to be safe enough to use, whereas vaccines researchers are starting from scratch.

Some completely new, experimental, coronavirus drugs are also being tested in the laboratory but are not yet ready for human tests .

Why do we need a treatment?

The most obvious reason for wanting a treatment is it will save lives, but it could also allow some lockdown measures to be lifted.

Having an effective treatment would, in essence, make coronavirus a milder disease.

If it stopped people who were admitted to hospital from needing ventilation, then there would be less risk of intensive care units being overwhelmed, so controls on people's lives may not need to be as strict.

So how are doctors treating patients now?

If you are infected by coronavirus, then for most people it would be mild and can be treated at home with bed-rest, paracetamol and plenty of fluids.

But some people need more intensive hospital treatment, which involves oxygen support such as ventilation.

China has been carrying out an ambitious plan to test everyone in Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 pandemic began, following the emergence of a cluster of new infections.

The authorities had pledged to test the city's inhabitants over a 10-day period, starting on 14 May.

We've looked at what was achieved, and over what period of time.

What was the target?

Wuhan has an estimated population of 11 million people.

But those already tested in the seven days prior to mass testing starting in their district, as well as any children under six years of age, have been excluded.

The total number may have been reduced further given that some residents who left Wuhan before the lockdown in January may well not have returned.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Testing every resident in 10 days would have been a huge challenge

The authorities said they would begin with people considered most at risk - such as those in more densely populated areas as well as those in key jobs such as healthcare.

We then need to consider the timeframe, which has shifted somewhat since the initial announcement.

The Wuhan authorities later suggested different districts within the city would be starting at different times.

""Each district finishes its tests within 10 days from the date it started them,"" the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control said, which effectively extended the deadline beyond the original pledge.

It still remains a very ambitious plan, so do we know how close they've come to achieving their goal?

How many have been tested?

All the data we have comes from the local health authorities in Wuhan, so we need to be aware of not having independent verification for the numbers.

But let's start with Wuhan's testing capacity before this latest mass campaign.

There were about 60 centres across the city, with an overall maximum capacity of 100,000 tests a day, according to the official Hubei Daily newspaper.

That would have made it impossible to reach everyone in Wuhan over 10 days. So testing capacity would have needed to be significantly boosted to meet the challenge.

Image copyright Getty Images

One way to scale up testing is to use a batch testing method. Chinese state media have reported that this has been used in Wuhan.

This process groups individual test samples together to speed up the whole process.

Reports suggest they have been using batches of between five and 10 samples in Wuhan, only carrying out individual tests if a batch proves positive.

This would be an efficient way to test large numbers of people where infection levels are low, as most batches would produce negative results.

So far, the authorities say they have found just over 200 positive cases out of all the tests done so far.

Even with this batch testing in place, processing capacity would have needed to be scaled up massively.

Health officials in Wuhan say they carried out 1.47m tests on a single day, 22 May - so a huge increase from the 100,000 a day prior to this testing campaign starting.

In total, according to the Hubei health commission website, nine million test samples had been taken by 24 May - 10 days after the campaign started.

Of these, the commission says 6.57 million had been processed.

That's a large number and although it's not possible to verify independently, it appears that Wuhan has managed to reach a large proportion of its population during the 10 day period.

However, by its own reckoning, the city still has some way to go to reach everyone.

More than 200 schools in South Korea have been forced to close just days after they re-opened, due to a new spike in virus cases.

Thousands of students had earlier on Wednesday returned to school as the country began easing virus restrictions.

But just a day later, 79 new cases were recorded, the highest daily figure in two months.

Most of these cases have been linked to a distribution centre outside Seoul.

The warehouse, in the city of Bucheon, is run by the country's biggest e-commerce firm Coupang, and officials have said the facility was not strictly complying with infection control measures. Health officials even discovered traces of Covid-19 on workers' shoes and clothes.

A total of 251 schools in Bucheon have now been forced to close. A report by the Korea Times, quoting the Ministry of Education, says a further 117 schools in the capital Seoul have also postponed their re-opening.

One student in Seoul, whose mother worked at the Coupang warehouse, had been found to have the virus.

Public parks and museums across Seoul and its surrounding cities have now been closed, businesses are being urged to encourage more flexible working, and people are once again being asked to avoid mass gatherings.

South Korea endured one of the worst outbreaks of the virus earlier this year, but had appeared to have brought it under control, thanks to an extensive ""trace, test and treat"" programme.

Recent weeks, however, have seen new clusters emerge, including one linked to a man who visited five nightclubs and bars in Seoul's nightlife district of Itaewon earlier this month.

73,Trump signs executive order targeting Twitter after fact-checking row,https://bbc.com/news/technology-52843986,[],"Image copyright AFP

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms.

He said the firms had ""unchecked power"" to censure and edit the views of users.

President Trump has regularly accused platforms such as Twitter and Facebook of stifling conservative voices.

The order, which is expected to face legal challenges, comes after Twitter decided to append fact-check labels to two of his tweets this week.

On Wednesday Mr Trump accused the company of election interference after it added a warning label to the tweets about claims of widespread fraud in mail-in voting - also known as postal votes.

Twitter and other social media platforms strongly condemned the executive order.

And early on Friday, Twitter hid one of President Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.

What does the executive order say?

Under a 1996 law, website operators, unlike traditional publishers, cannot generally be held responsible for content posted by users.

The sites are also protected from lawsuits if they block posts deemed obscene, violent ""or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected"".

The executive order argues that this immunity should no longer apply if a social network edits posts, such as by adding a warning or a label.

It also says ""deceptive"" blocking, including removing a post for reasons other than those described in a website's terms of service, should not be protected.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio is among those arguing that the platforms take on the role of a ""publisher"" when they add fact-check labels to posts.

""The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers,"" Mr Rubio said.

""But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher, then they should no longer be shielded from liability.""

The executive order also calls for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to spell out what type of content blocking will be considered deceptive or inconsistent with a service provider's terms and conditions.

What effect will the order have?

Donald Trump promised ""big action"" in response to Twitter's decision to append a fact-check message to two of his posts. While his announcement of an executive order was heavy on rhetoric - accusing social media companies of being monopolies that threaten free speech - it will be a long process before the talk turns into real action, big or otherwise.

Independent government agencies will have to review federal law, promulgate new regulations, vote on them and then - in all likelihood - defend them in court. By the time it's all over, the November presidential election could have come and gone.

That explains why Trump is also pushing for new congressional legislation - a more straightforward way of changing US policy toward social media companies.

The real purpose of the president's order, however, may be symbolic. At the very least, the move will cause Twitter to think twice about attempting to moderate or fact-check his posts on their service.

The president relies on Twitter to get his message out without filtering from the mainstream media. If Twitter itself start blunting one of his favourite communication tools, he is sending a message that he will push back - and make things, at a minimum, uncomfortable for the company.

How have the social networks responded?

Twitter called the order ""a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law,"" adding that Section 230 ""protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it's underpinned by democratic values"".

Google, which owns YouTube, said changing Section 230 would ""hurt America's economy and its global leadership on internet freedom.""

""Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences,"" the firm said in a statement to the BBC.

In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship.

""I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,"" said Mr Zuckerberg.

What sparked the latest row?

The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social media companies flared up again on Tuesday, when two of his posts were given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time.

He had tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is no way (zero) that mail-in ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""

Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page describing the claims as ""unsubstantiated"".

Then on Wednesday, Mr Trump threatened to ""strongly regulate"" social-media platforms.

He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"", and that he would not allow this to happen.

In an earlier tweet, he said Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".

Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.""

Skip Twitter post by @jack Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that’s me. Please leave our employees out of this. We’ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make. — jack (@jack) May 28, 2020 Report

75,UK could offer 'path to citizenship' for Hong Kong's British passport holders,https://bbc.com/news/uk-52842303,[],"Image copyright AFP Image caption Beijing's proposed security law has sparked protests in Hong Kong

The UK could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to UK citizenship if China does not suspend plans for a security law in the territory, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says.

It comes after China's parliament backed proposal that would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority.

There are fears the legislation could end Hong Kong's unique status.

China said it reserved the right to take ""countermeasures"" against the UK.

Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the UK and China had agreed that holders of British National (Overseas) - or BNO - passport should not enjoy UK residency.

""All such BNO passport holders are Chinese nationals and if the UK insists on changing this practice it will not only violate its own stance but also international law,"" he added.

There are 300,000 BNO passport holders in Hong Kong who have the right to visit the UK for up to six months without a visa.

Mr Raab's statement came after the UK, US, Australia and Canada issued joint condemnation of Beijing's plan, saying imposing the security law would undermine the ""one country, two systems"" framework agreed before Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.

The framework guaranteed Hong Kong some autonomy and afforded rights and freedoms that do not exist in mainland China.

China has rejected foreign criticism of the proposed law, which could be in force as early as the end of June.

Li Zhanshu, chairman of the parliamentary committee that will now draft the law, said it was ""in line with the fundamental interests of all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots"".

What did Raab say?

British National (Overseas) passports were issued to people in Hong Kong by the UK before the transfer of the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.

Announcing the possible change in policy, Mr Raab said the six-month limit on stays in the UK for BNO holders would be scrapped.

""If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation, we will remove that six month limit and allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship,"" he said.

The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale says that in Beijing might not mind if some pro-democracy campaigners escape to the UK, but the flight of talented wealth creators would be of concern.

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Mr Raab says time limits on visits by Hong Kong BNO holders could be scrapped

Some MPs want the UK to go further and offer automatic citizenship. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said BNO holders should have an automatic right to live and work in the UK.

The government has in the past rejected calls to give BNO holders in Hong Kong full citizenship.

Last year more than 100,000 people in Hong Kong signed a petition calling for full rights. The government responded by saying that only UK citizens and certain Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK and cited a 2007 review which said giving BNO holders full citizenship would be a breach of the agreement under which the UK handed Hong Kong back to China.

However in 1972 the UK offered asylum to some 30,000 Ugandan Asians with British Overseas passports after the then-military ruler Idi Amin ordered about 60,000 Asians to leave. At the time some MPs said India should take responsibility for the refugees, but Prime Minister Edward Heath said the UK had a duty to accept them.

What other reaction has there been?

Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy earlier said the UK had to be more robust with Beijing.

Referring to the security law, she told the BBC: ""This is the latest in a series of attempts by China to start to erode the joint declaration which Britain co-signed with the Chinese government when we handed over Hong Kong, and protected its special status.""

""We want to see the UK government really step up now,"" she said.

Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK should bring together a coalition of countries to avoid a tragedy in the territory.

He told the BBC: ""This is definitely the most dangerous period there has ever been in terms of that agreement.

""With our unique legal situation, Britain does have a responsibility now to pull together that international coalition and to do what we can to protect the people of Hong Kong.""

On Thursday Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""We are deeply concerned about China's legislation related to national security in Hong Kong.

""We have been very clear that the security legislation risks undermining the principle of one country, two systems.

""We are in close contact with our international partners on this and the Foreign Secretary spoke to US Secretary [Mike] Pompeo last night.""

He added: ""The steps taken by the Chinese government place the Joint Declaration under direct threat and do undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.""

On Wednesday, Mr Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it could no longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China.

77,Rohingya refugee crisis: 'The bodies were thrown out of the boat',https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-52832841,"['Swaminathan Natarajan', 'Moazzem Hossain', 'Bbc World Service']","Image caption Khadiza fled Myanmar after her husband and son were killed

""Nobody knows how many people have died. It could be 50 or even more,"" recalls Khadiza Begum.

The 50-year-old was among 396 Rohingya Muslims who had tried to reach Malaysia but who finally returned to the Bangladeshi shore after the boat carrying them was stranded at sea for two months.

Her estimate on the number of deaths comes from the funerals her son officiated as an imam, a Muslim preacher, on the same boat.

The human smugglers never delivered them to their longed-for destination.

Khadiza had to run away from her home in Myanmar because of violence that UN investigators described as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".

Neighbouring Bangladesh gave her shelter, settling the fleeing Rohingya Muslims in what has now become the world's largest refugee camp.

Around one million Rohingya are housed in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, and some among them, like Khadiza, hold dreams of a better life in Malaysia, lying across the Bay of Bengal.

Image caption The refugee boat was carrying people to Malaysia

But in Khadiza's case, the dream turned into a nightmare.

She recounts how the crew - the human traffickers - tried to conceal deaths on their crowded boat.

""They would run both engines so that none could hear the sound of splashing water when bodies were thrown out.""

Often, she says, the bodies were disposed of during the night: ""I know for sure at least 14 to 15 women died.""

The death of a woman who was sitting next to her continues to traumatise Khadiza. Severely dehydrated, the woman was initially disoriented and behaving strangely. The crew took her to the upper deck of the boat, where Khadiza says she died.

""I am still haunted by her death. She died in front of our eyes.""

The woman had four children with her. ""My son informed the eldest daughter, just 16 years old, that her mother had died.""

Image caption Khadiza's boat was adrift for two months

""The woman's three other children didn't know what happened to their mother."" she says. ""They were crying. It was heart-breaking.

""The body was immediately thrown out.""

Khadiza is a mother of four, too. She was made homeless and stateless in 2017 after her husband and one of her sons were killed during army operations in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.

Her village was torched, forcing her to go to Bangladesh to settle in the Cox's Bazar refugee camp with her children.

After marrying off her eldest daughter, she craved to provide a better life for her remaining son and daughter. ""We had a tough life. I didn't see any future for us in a refugee camp.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch: Who are the Rohingya?

Stories she heard about the Rohingya who crossed the sea to Malaysia for a better life fascinated her. Khadiza sold her jewels and put together $750 (£610) to pay to traffickers who would arrange a boat for them.

Then one night in February, she received the phone call she had been waiting for.

She kept her intentions secret and bundled some clothes and gold jewels in a small bag. ""I told my friends and neighbours that I would be going away for medical treatment,"" she tells the BBC.

With her son and daughter in tow, Khadiza locked their home and slipped away in darkness.

A man met them near a bus stand, guiding them to a farm house where she saw hundreds of others.

The group was taken to a boat that slowly set sail in the Bay of Bengal, between the Saint Marin's Islands in Bangladesh and Akiab in Myanmar.

""I had been planning for months. I wanted a better life. I was dreaming of a new life in a new country,"" she says.

Image caption Khadiza’s son officiated the funerals of those who died on board

After two days they were transferred into a another boat: a bigger one, full of people.

Khadiza says she didn't even have room to stretch her legs: ""There were families with women and children. I think there were more than 500 people.""

The boat was larger than a typical trawler used in South Asia, but certainly not big enough to carry so many people.

Crew members stayed on the upper deck, women were given the middle deck and men were pushed to the bottom. Ironically, the crew were Burmese men from Myanmar - the country from where the Rohingya were forced out.

""At the beginning I was scared,"" Khadiza remembers. ""I didn't know what our destiny would be, but as we settled in, I started dreaming again.

""I thought we would achieve a better life. So whatever troubles we were going through did not matter.""

The boat lacked basic facilities like water and sanitation. Khadiza washed herself only twice in two months by drawing water from the sea, in front of others.

Toilets consisted of two wooden planks with a hole in the middle.

""A few days after we started our journey to Malaysia, a boy fell through the hole into the sea,"" Khadiza remembers. ""He fell and died.""

It was the first of many deaths she witnessed.

Image caption Khadiza believes at least 50 people died during the journey

After sailing for seven days, sometimes in bad weather, the group finally spotted the Malaysian coast. Here, there were expecting smaller boats to transport them to the land.

But none arrived.

The coronavirus outbreak had tightened Malaysian security: with coast guards conducting more frequent patrols, making it difficult to sneak in the country.

The captain told the refugees they would not be able to land in Malaysia. Khadiza's hopes had been shattered by the pandemic.

The crew had to retreat, but faced a shortage of food and water.

On their way to Malaysia the refugees had been given rice twice a day, sometimes with lentils, and a mug of water.

""At first, it became one meal every day. Then one meal every two days - just plain rice with nothing else,"" Khadiza recalls.

The lack of drinking water was becoming unbearable.

Khadiza says that, in desperation, some of the refugees even drank seawater: ""People would try to quench their thirst by soaking clothes in water, then wringing it get the drops in their mouths.""

Days later, off the coast of Thailand, a small boat arranged by the human traffickers brought in much needed supplies.

But, while they were waiting for another chance to get to Malaysia, the Burmese navy intercepted them.

""They arrested the captain and three crew members, but they were released,"" Khadiza says. ""I guess they made some sort of a deal.""

Their second and last attempt to land in Malaysia was also to end in failure. It became clear to everyone on the boat that they were going nowhere.

""We were drifting around in the sea, with no hope of ever reaching the shore. People were getting desperate. We kept asking ourselves how long we could survive like this.""

So, a group of refugees went up to the crew and pleaded with them to disembark anywhere, regardless of whether it was Myanmar or Bangladesh.

But the crew refused, believing it too risky. They could be arrested and their boat taken away.

As the boat drifted aimlessly in Bay of Bengal, stories accusing the crew of rape and torture started circulating.

""Things were getting out of control,"" Khadiza says. ""I heard one of the crew members was attacked and killed - his body dumped in the sea.""

There were 10 Burmese crew members overseeing almost 400 refugees. ""They realised it would be very difficult for them to fight and win,"" she says.

The crew demanded more money to hire small boats which would take them ashore. Those on board coughed up another $1,200.

After a few days, a small boat approached them. Immediately, the captain and most of the crew members jumped in to run away.

Those remaining managed to steer the boat towards Bangladesh, with the help of two remaining crew members.

Image caption Khadiza Begum is now back in the refugee camp again, traumatised by her experience

""I was so happy when I finally saw the coast for the first time in two months."" Khadiza remembers.

They were back in Bangladesh again. After seeing the people in such a bad condition, local villagers informed the Bangladeshi Coast Guard.

After spending two weeks in quarantine, Khadiza returned to her refugee camp, only to find out that her place was now occupied by another family.

She has no hope of going back to Myanmar to live again on the land she farmed.

She now has to share a tiny space with her son and daughter.

""I lost everything for my dream,"" she says, in quiet contemplation. ""Never make the mistake I made.""

A police station in Minneapolis has been set alight during a third night of protests over the death of an unarmed black man in custody on Monday.

A police officer was filmed kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, 46, despite him saying he could not breathe.

President Donald Trump said ""thugs"" were dishonouring his memory and called on the National Guard to restore order.

Twitter accused Mr Trump of glorifying violence in a post that said: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts.""

Mr Floyd's family have demanded that the four police officers implicated in his death face murder charges. Prosecutors have said they are still gathering evidence.

The incident has added to longstanding anger over the police killings of black Americans, including the recent case of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky.

There have also been demonstrations in other US cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix and Memphis.

What happened on Thursday night?

The last few days have seen buildings in Minneapolis burned to the ground or looted.

On Thursday, protesters gathered outside the police department's 3rd Precinct, which is near where Mr Floyd died and has been the epicentre of the unrest.

Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse the crowd. But the cordon around the police station was eventually breached by protesters, who set fire to it and two other nearby buildings as the officers withdrew.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption George Floyd's death has reignited criticism of the way black Americans are treated by the police

The police department said the 3rd Precinct was evacuated shortly after 22:00 ""in the interest of the safety of our personnel"".

Later, the city government tweeted that it had heard ""unconfirmed reports that gas lines to the 3rd Precinct have been cut and other explosives materials are in the building"". It urged people near the building to retreat for their own safety.

At a news conference early on Friday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said there had been no choice but to evacuate the police station.

""The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life, of our officers or the public. We could not risk serious injury to anyone and we will continue to patrol the 3rd Precinct entirely.""

Mr Frey called the rioting and looting ""unacceptable"", but he added that he and everyone else recognised there was ""a lot of pain and anger"" in the city.

He spoke after a tweet from President Donald Trump blamed Thursday's violence on a ""lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis and warned that he would send in the National Guard and ""get the job done right"" if Mr Frey failed to restore order.

National Guard personnel are normally under state control, although they can be put under federal control in emergencies.

Mr Trump also tweeted: ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""

Image copyright Twitter

Twitter subsequently placed a ""public interest notice"" on the message.

The company said it ""violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today"". It added that it did not remove the tweet ""given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance"".

Twitter flagged two of the president's posts as potentially misleading earlier this week, prompting him to issue an executive order seeking to limit the legal immunity of social media firms.

Image copyright EPA Image caption The Minneapolis Police Department said the 3rd Precinct had been evacuated

Before the police station was set ablaze, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz had activated the state's National Guard troops at the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and the neighbouring city of St Paul, declaring the situation a ""peacetime emergency"".

He said the looting, vandalism and arson of Wednesday night had resulted in damage to many businesses, including ones owned by minorities.

""George Floyd's death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,"" he said in a statement, calling on all protests to remain peaceful.

The protests began on Tuesday afternoon, when hundreds of people came to the intersection where the incident had taken place.

Organisers tried to keep the protest peaceful and maintain coronavirus social distancing, with demonstrators chanting ""I can't breathe"" and ""It could've been me"".

During the second night of demonstrations on Wednesday, the crowd grew into the thousands, with protesters pelting police with stones and throwing back some throwing tear-gas canisters.

There was a stand-off outside the 3rd Precinct, where officers formed a barricade to prevent protesters gaining entry.

What has been the reaction?

Mayor Frey called on Wednesday for criminal charges to filed against the policeman who was filmed pinning down Mr Floyd. The officer and three others involved in the arrest have already been fired.

Mr Floyd's brother, Philonise, told CNN on Thursday: ""I'm never gonna get my brother back,"" he said. ""We need justice.""

Speaking through tears, he said the officers who ""executed my brother in broad daylight"" must be arrested and that he was ""tired of seeing black men die"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fires raged overnight close to the site where George Floyd was pinned down by police officers

United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has also condemned Mr Floyd's death, saying the role of ""entrenched and pervasive racial discrimination"" must be recognised and dealt with.

She called for protesters to act peacefully, and for police to ""take utmost care not to inflame the current situation even more"".

President Donald Trump ""was very upset"" when he saw the footage of Mr Floyd's death, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Thursday. ""He wants justice to be served,"" added.

A number of celebrities and athletes, including John Boyega, LeBron James, Beyonce, and Justin Bieber, have also expressed outrage over the incident.

The incident echoes the case of Eric Garner, who was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014. His death became a rallying cry against police brutality and a catalyst in the Black Lives Matter movement.

What happened to George Floyd?

Officers responding to reports of the use of counterfeit money approached Mr Floyd in his vehicle on Monday.

According to police, he was told to step away from the car, physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. The police statement noted his apparent ""medical distress"".

Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started.

The city has identified the four officers involved as Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng.

Local media have named Mr Chauvin as the officer seen with his knee on Mr Floyd's neck.

The Minneapolis Police Officers Federation said the officers were co-operating with the investigation. ""We must review all video. We must wait for the medical examiner's report,"" it said in a statement.

One of the world's oldest bottles of Cognac has been sold in an online auction for £118,580.

The spirit dates back to 1762 and has been stored in a family cellar for the past 140 years. It should still taste good, Sotheby's auction house said.

The bottle was bought by a private collector in Asia and has set a record for the most expensive bottle of Cognac sold at auction, Sotheby's added.

It is one of only three bottles of the rare Gautier Cognac still in existence.

Of the two other smaller bottles, one is in a museum in France and the other was sold at auction in New York in 2014 for about £48,000, Sotheby's said.

Much like champagne, only brandy made in the French region of Cognac can bear the prestigious name.

The auction house's spirits specialist, Jonny Fowle, said in the run-up to the sale that the 258-year-old bottle should still taste good.

He said the condition of the bottle was ""really good"" and there had been little evaporation.

""We can assume the alcohol level in it is pretty high and that would have acted as a preservative for hundreds of years. The liquid in the bottle would have maintained its character,"" he added.

85,Twitter hides Trump tweet for 'glorifying violence',https://bbc.com/news/technology-52846679,[],"Image copyright Getty Images

Twitter has hidden one of President Donald Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.

But instead of being deleted, it has been replaced with a warning and can be viewed by clicking on it.

The warning says ""Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.""

It is the latest in an escalating row between Twitter and the White House.

Mr Trump was tweeting about the US city of Minneapolis, which has seen consecutive nights of protests following the death of a black man in police custody.

Image copyright Twitter Image caption Users have to press the View button to be able to see the President's tweet

The president said he would ""send in the National Guard"", and followed that up with a warning that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""

That second tweet was hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"".

Twitter's policy of adding a warning to, rather than deleting, tweets that break its rules when it comes to major public figures was announced in mid-2019. But the social network has never used it on Mr Trump - nor deleted any of his tweets before.

""This is the bravest and riskiest thing I've ever seen Twitter - or any social media giant - do,"" said Carl Miller, from the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at UK-based think-tank Demos.

""This pours rocket fuel over the online-harm-versus-free-speech debate. Online content policy doesn't get more incendiary than this.""

The same post remains unaltered on Facebook, without any warning attached.

For years Twitter resisted calls to treat Donald Trump like any other user and make him follow its rules. Then, on Wednesday, it made a first small move, not removing a tweet but adding a fact-checking link.

The company then had two choices - hunker down and weather the storm or continue to take action in accordance with its stated rules. It has now chosen the latter course of action, calling the President out for glorifying violence.

Any other user would have had their tweet removed, and might have seen their account suspended.

It now looks as though there is no easy way out for either of the two adversaries - a huge battle over the limits of free speech and the rights of social media firms to moderate content is looming.

The move means that other users will not be able to like, reply, or retweet it, Twitter said - but would still be able to retweet with a comment attached.

In a Twitter thread, the social network said: ""This tweet violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.""

The ""historical context"" is a reference to the late 1960s, when the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" was coined by Miami Police Chief Walter Headley, in reference to his aggressive policing policies in black neighbourhoods.

""We've taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.""

It comes hours after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms.

Earlier this week, Twitter used its fact-checking function to attach warnings to the president's tweets for the first time. That led the President to threaten to ""shut down"" the social networks over allegedly stifling free speech.

The executive order signed by Mr Trump has no immediate effect on the social networks, however - it instead begins a lengthy process that may result in changes down the line.","Image copyright Getty ImagesTwitter has hidden one of President Donald Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.

87,Gough Whitlam dismissal: Australian court grants access to Queen's letters,https://bbc.com/news/world-australia-52844272,[],"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Queen with then Governor-General Sir John Kerr in 1977

Letters written by the Queen before the 1975 dismissal of then Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam can be made public, an Australian court has ruled.

Mr Whitlam's government was removed by her representative at the time, Governor-General Sir John Kerr, and replaced with an opposition party.

The dismissal is often described as the most controversial episode in Australian political history.

It is not known what the letters between the Queen and Sir John contain.

Historians have long questioned what Buckingham Palace knew about the removal of Mr Whitlam, a progressive whose reforms divided Australia after two decades of conservative rule.

More than 200 letters have been kept sealed in the National Archives since 1978, but on Friday the High Court of Australia ruled they could be accessed in the national interest.

It follows a challenge by historian Prof Jenny Hocking to have them released as state records - documents which are disclosed after a 31-year embargo.

What happened to Gough Whitlam?

Mr Whitlam and his Labor Party came to power in 1972, implementing policies which many celebrated, but he grew less popular amid a troubled economy and a fierce political opposition.

On 11 November 1975, he was sacked on the justification that he had failed to get parliament to approve a national budget and then subsequently declined to resign or call an election.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gough Whitlam raged against his sacking in 1975

As Australia is a constitutional monarchy with the Queen as head of state, the governor-general had the authority to do this.

But it was an unprecedented action which shocked the country and prompted questions about Australia's political independence.

Some viewed it as a ""constitutional coup"", sparking strikes and violent demonstrations as well as discussion about the country becoming a republic.

But others celebrated his departure. In a general election held a few months later, voters overwhelmingly elected Malcolm Fraser's centre-right Liberal Party - which had been acting as a caretaker government.

What are the letters?

The collection of letters, dating from before and after the dismissal, are between Sir John, the Queen, and her personal secretary.

On Friday, Prof Hocking welcomed the court's 6-1 majority ruling as an ""important decision"" for all Australians.

Prof Hocking has previously told the BBC she believes the letters will reveal whether there was influence on Sir John's decision.

She plans to travel from Melbourne to Canberra to access the letters once coronavirus-related travel restrictions are lifted, local media reported.

Her legal challenge, which initially failed in a lower court last year, had been crowdfunded by a ""Release the Palace Letters"" campaign.","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Queen with then Governor-General Sir John Kerr in 1977Letters written by the Queen before the 1975 dismissal of then Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam can be made public, an Australian court has ruled.

89,Moscow more than doubles city's Covid-19 death toll,https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-52843976,[],"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Moscow has been the epicentre of the epidemic in Russia for many weeks

Moscow's authorities have more than doubled the official death toll from Covid-19 in the Russian capital for the month of April.

The city's health department now says 1,561 people died from the disease - not 639 as initially announced.

The department stressed that the new tally included even the most ""controversial, debatable"" cases.

Moscow-based reporters had said the official numbers were too low, but were accused of fake news and distortion.

Confirmation that the numbers had been under-reported emerged before Russia announced 232 new deaths, its biggest daily death toll during the pandemic so far.

With 8,572 new recorded infections, Russia has the third highest number in the world of 387,623 cases. The official number of deaths stands at 4,374.

The government says the country's mass testing programme is responsible for that low mortality rate - but many believe the numbers are in fact far higher.

Although the number of new daily infections is down from a peak of over 11,000 earlier this month, health officials in Russia's second biggest city, St Petersburg, say hospitals there are running at peak capacity.

Why was Moscow's Covid-19 death toll revised?

Moscow's health department said the death toll was revised following post-mortem examinations.

They had confirmed coronavirus as the cause of death in 169 cases where tests had initially been negative.

In addition, 756 people who died of other causes in April had tested positive for coronavirus. The officials said in many cases here the virus was a significant factor, playing the role of a ""catalyst"".

This new methodology is likely to mean the death toll will increase across the country, although Moscow was the epicentre of the epidemic for many weeks, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports.

The Moscow health department stressed that even the new count put the Covid-19 mortality rate for the city at under 3% - suggesting that was well below comparable cities, our correspondent says.

But the authorities also conceded that the figures for May would be higher.

In a separate development on Thursday, a group of well-known Russian journalists were arrested in Moscow as they took part in single-person protests over a 15-day jail term handed down to a colleague.

The journalists accused police of using the Covid-19 outbreak to crack down on activists. Most have since been released, but charged with various offences.","The city's health department now says 1,561 people died from the disease - not 639 as initially announced.

97,Men hired for sexual fantasy break into wrong house,https://bbc.com/news/world-australia-52843846,[],"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A broom was the key element in the fantasy

In a sex fantasy gone wrong, two men with machetes entered the wrong house in New South Wales, Australia, before quickly realising their error.

One of them has now been acquitted of entering a home armed with a weapon in July 2019, Australian media report.

They had been hired to carry out a client's fantasy of being tied up in his underwear and stroked with a broom.

The judge concluded that ""the facts of the case are unusual"".

The role play was arranged over Facebook by a man near Griffith, New South Wales, who provided his address to the hired pair.

""He was willing to pay A$5,000 if it was 'really good',"" the judge said.

However, the client moved to another address 50km (30 miles) away without updating the two men. They then entered a home on the street of the original address.

When the resident noticed a light on in his kitchen at 06:15, he assumed it was a friend who came by daily to make morning coffee.

When the men called out the name of their client, the resident turned on the light and removed a sleep apnoea mask he was wearing.

It was then that he saw them standing above his bed with the machetes, which they appeared to have brought as props for the role play.

Renault is cutting 15,000 jobs worldwide as part of a €2bn (£1.8bn) cost-cutting plan after seeing sales plunge because of the virus pandemic.

""This plan is essential,"" said interim boss Clotilde Delbos, who announced cuts in production to focus on more profitable car models.

Some 4,600 job cuts will be in France, and the firm said on Friday that it had begun talks with unions.

On Thursday, Renault's strategic partner Nissan unveiled huge job cuts.

Renault, 15% owned by the French state, said six sites are under review.

The company is slashing costs by cutting the number of subcontractors in areas such as engineering, reducing the number of components it uses, freezing expansion plans in Romania and Morocco and shrinking gearbox manufacturing worldwide.

The French firm plans to trim its global production capacity to 3.3 million vehicles in 2024 from 4 million now, focusing on areas like small vans or electric cars.

Scaling back

Renault is part of a three-way alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi. On Thursday, Nissan said it would close its factory in Barcelona with the loss of about 2,800 jobs in a bid to cut costs, prompting protests at the Spanish plant.

Cost-cutting measures announced by both Renault and Nissan mark a departure from the ambitious expansion plan devised by now-ousted leader of the alliance, Carlos Ghosn.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ex-boss Carlos Ghosn fled from Japan to Lebanon in December

Renault's interim chief executive Ms Delbos said during a press conference on Friday: ""We have to change our mindset.

""We're not looking to be on top of the world, what we want is a sustainable and profitable company.""

Renault, which claims more than 4% of the global car market, said its plans would affect about 10% of its 179,000-strong global workforce and cost up to €1.2bn (£1.1bn).

Ms Delbos added that Renault would review each region in order to decide where job cuts will fall. ""This will help us come back to our ideal size,"" she said.

Falling sales

Both Nissan and Renault were already facing falling sales before the Covid-19 outbreak worsened trading.

Renault's sales were down 3% last year and the number of vehicles sold in the first three months of 2020 fell by 25%, before dropping further in April.

The struggling firm is currently in talks with the French government over a €5bn emergency loan package.

The French government has also pledged €8bn in wider rescue funds aimed at shoring up the country's car industry. In exchange, President Emmanuel Macron had said Renault should keep workers and production in the country.

By Russell Hotten, BBC News

We're coming ""back to bases"" was how Renault euphemistically portrayed its retrenchment after seeing a collapse in sales and profits. Former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn had targeted 5 million car sales by 2022. Today's restructuring sees the company cut maximum production capacity to 3.3 million vehicles by 2024.

The news does more than rip up Renault's previous strategy. It reveals more of the shape of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. While they will co-operate on cutting costs, each company will take the lead on certain new-car developments.

And there's a geographical split: Renault focusing on Europe and Russia, Nissan on China, Japan and the US, and Mitsubishi on South East Asia. The days when the carmakers were tipped to merge into one global titan are long gone.

Presenting the plan is the easy bit; far more difficult is the execution. Renault has too many brands, and was slow to capitalise on growing markets. Its cost base is high. French rival PSA, for example, uses the same engines, chassis and gearbox on most small cars. Renault's technical base is not as efficient.

And it was telling that Renault did not say which French sites would shut. Among the 15,000 job cuts worldwide is 10% of Renault's domestic workforce. The government has still to sign off on a loan to Renault, so there will be hard bargaining with the unions before the money is handed over.

That might explain why Renault today played down reports it could put some production into Nissan's UK plant at Sunderland. Having French taxpayers help prop up a company that then creates jobs in the UK is not a good look.","""This plan is essential,"" said interim boss Clotilde Delbos, who announced cuts in production to focus on more profitable car models.

103,Why India must battle the shame of period stain,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52830427,[],"Image copyright Niraj Gera

Discrimination against menstruating women is widespread in India, where periods have long been a taboo and considered impure.

They are often excluded from social and religious events, denied entry into temples and shrines and even kept out of kitchens.

On the occasion of World Menstrual Hygiene Day, award winning photographer Niraj Gera attempts to de-stigmatise periods in this hard-hitting series called Sacred Stains.

Image copyright Niraj Gera

Given the lack of conversation about periods, according to one study, 71% of adolescent girls in India are unaware of menstruation until they get it themselves.

Campaigners say it shows that parents rarely prepare their daughters for something they know is bound to happen. And this unpreparedness leads to so much avoidable fear and anxiety.

Image copyright Niraj Gera

The difficulty of accessing sanitary pads is another major issue.

India scrapped a 12% tax on sanitary products in 2018 after months of campaigning by activists.

Campaigners had argued that menstrual hygiene products were not a luxury and periods were not a choice that a woman could simply opt out of.

However, tax exemption is only a small step towards a much longer journey of making menstrual health and hygiene an accessible reality for every woman in the country.

Image copyright Niraj Gera

According to one study, only 36% of India's 355 million menstruating females use sanitary napkins, while the rest use old rags, husk, ash, leaves, mud and soil and such other life-threatening materials to manage their flow.

And menstrual health experts say the current coronavirus crisis has worsened matters further in India. The country is under a strict lockdown which has severely impacted production and supplies of menstrual hygiene products.

Of course, period poverty does not only affect women in India.

According to Plan International UK, an international development charity, one in 10 disadvantaged girls below the age of 21 cannot afford sanitary products and uses unhygienic substitutes such as newspaper, toilet paper and socks.

Image copyright Niraj Gera

From an early age, girls learn to live with the pain and fear and seldom do we see a girl seek help when in physical or mental discomfort due to periods.

But with a surge in the use of social media in recent years, women have begun sharing their stories about menstruation too.

Yet this freedom is often questioned and those sharing their stories are threatened with bans, while trolls who indulge in moral policing and shaming women go scot-free.

""It's time to not silence them with shame, but give them the freedom and knowledge to deal with the pain. Social media is a powerful tool and it should be used to spread positivity and awareness among the people,"" says Mr Gera.

Image copyright Niraj Gera

Millions of families across India cannot afford to buy menstrual hygiene products.

In the photo above, a daily-wage labourer's daughter wants a pad, Mr Gera says, but feels guilty to even ask her family for the money to buy it.

For them, it's a toss-up between spending on food for the family or purchasing sanitary napkins.

The photographer has launched a petition through his charity - Humanify Foundation - demanding free distribution of pads to all women and girls living below the poverty line in India.

Image copyright Niraj Gera

Nearly 23 million girls drop out of school annually after they start their periods, according to a 2014 study by Dasra, a charity that works on issues of adolescent health.

Campaigners say the main reasons are a lack of clean toilets in schools and poor access to sanitary products.

There's also fear of staining and girls worry about being mocked by their classmates.

The study also found that a large number of women considered periods as dirty, explaining why menstruating women are often ostracised from social and cultural activities and are forced to put up with all sorts of restrictions.

Image copyright Niraj Gera

""It is time we realise that menstruation is just a biological process and the secrecy surrounding it must go. It is important to normalise menstruation and destroy taboos around this natural process,"" he says.

""Talking is all it takes to begin a transformation and it's time we did it.""

Little remains of the Berlin Wall, but a new monument in the German capital will honour the protesters who defied the communist state in 1989 and led the divided nation to reunification.

A groundbreaking ceremony has just taken place for the Monument to Freedom and Unity, in central Berlin. The 50m-long (164ft) bowl will move gently up and down when enough people stand on it, and it should be completed by the end of next year.

In a guide to the design, architects Milla & Partner, who won a competition called ""Citizens in Motion"", say ""freedom and unity aren't static conditions, they require participation and interaction"".

""When there are at least 30 more people standing on one half of the bowl than on the other, the bowl will start to move, slowly and gently.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption German Culture Commissioner Monika Grütters (C) took part in the ground-breaking ceremony with designer Johannes Milla (far left) and architect Sebastian Letz (far right)

In 1989 protesters in communist East Germany chanted ""Wir sind das Volk!"" (We are the People), which later became ""Wir sind ein Volk!"" (We are one People). The second slogan captured the desire to reunite Germany and remove the Cold War border.

The two slogans will be inscribed on the bowl in big letters.

Image copyright Milla & partner Image caption The architects' vision of the monument by night

There is also political symbolism in the federal government's backing for the project - in a city already rich in monuments and reminders of Germany's turbulent, violent past.

Far-right nationalism, contemptuous of liberal democracy, has made a comeback, with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) now the biggest opposition party in parliament.

German unity has also been put under stress by the coronavirus crisis, with federal and regional politicians often in dispute.

Image copyright Milla & partner Image caption The bowl and surrounding pedestrian space will cover 700 sq m

Part of the monument's site was formerly the plinth of an equestrian statue of Kaiser Wilhelm I, king of Prussia in the 19th Century and then first emperor of a united Germany.

The architects say ""the chequered history of the location is still there to see - but now Kaiser Wilhelm will be replaced by the people"".

Image copyright EPA Image caption The monument will overlook a stretch of water. The old Prussian royal palace is being turned into a huge exhibition space called Humboldt Forum.

The project - with an estimated cost of €17m (£15m; $19m) - was granted German parliamentary approval in 2007 but was delayed for budgetary reasons and also because bats were found to be sheltering at the site.

At Thursday's ceremony German Commissioner for Culture Monika Grütters said the monument would honour ""the civil courage of those people who raised their voices for democratic rights and freedoms"".

""The unity of Germany and a united Europe would have remained, without the 'citizens in motion', what they were for a long time: utopian hopes for a distant future.

""Remembrance of the peaceful revolution therefore deserves to have this prominent place in the heart of the German capital.""

114,Hong Kong: What is the BNO and what does the UK move mean?,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52844353,[],"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Around 300,000 in Hong Kong hold a British National (Overseas) passport

The UK has said it is considering more rights for holders of a special passport issued to some people in Hong Kong.

The territory, which used to be a British colony, was handed back to China in 1997. Anyone born before then is eligible to apply for a British National (Overseas) passport, known as a BNO.

If China implements a controversial proposed security law, people holding the BNO, could get a ""path to citizenship"", the UK said.

What is the BNO and who has one?

The BNO passport is essentially a travel document that does not carry citizenship rights with it - although you are entitled to some consular assistance outside of Hong Kong and China with it.

It was issued to people in Hong Kong by the UK before Hong Kong was handed over to China.

Around 300,000 people currently hold a BNO passport, allowing them to visit the UK visa-free for six months. An estimated 2.9 million people are eligible for a BNO passport, said the British Consulate General in Hong Kong.

Though it gives the passport holder the right to remain in the UK for up to six months, it doesn't automatically allow them to reside or work there. They also aren't allowed to access public funds, including things like government benefits.

BNO holders cannot pass this status on to their children.

What is the UK proposing - and why?

China on Thursday formally approved a plan to impose controversial national security legislation in Hong Kong. It could go into effect as early as the end of June.

Hong Kong was handed back to China, on a number of conditions. These include the region's high level of autonomy and maintaining certain rights like freedom of speech that do not exist in mainland China.

But this new plan, if put into law, would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong, and many are concerned it could end Hong Kong's unique status.

The move triggered a wave of criticism around the world, with many - including Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong - urging the UK to stand up for the territory.

Image caption Under current rules, BNO holders are allowed to stay for six months

Later on Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the country would move to scrap the six-month stay limit for BNO holders if China goes on to officially implement the law.

Mr Raab said that BNO passport holders would be allowed to ""apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship"".

What difference could it make?

As a way to help people in Hong Kong who would rather not stay there if the new security laws are implemented, it might prove more symbolic.

For starters only a small percentage of people in Hong Kong currently have a BNO.

But also, the people who the security laws are aimed at - the young anti-mainland protesters who have been getting into violent confrontations with police for months - are not likely to be eligible for the BNO because of their age.

Additionally, though the BNO gives the passport holder the right to visit the UK for up to a year potentially, it's not clear what other benefits the extension might bring, or if the UK would make it any easier administratively for those already in the country to apply for work or study.

On social media, some Hong Kongers dismissed it as a gesture that amounted to little more than a 12-month tourist visa.

Effectively, it means that those who come to stay in the UK for a year, and who have the funds to be able to extend this enough, could eventually be eligible to apply for citizenship.

It cuts out some of the administrative hoops BNO holders would have had to jump through before this move if they wanted this path.

How has China reacted?

China has firmly opposed the move by the UK, saying it is a violation of the handover agreement that stipulates BNO passport holders do not enjoy UK residency.

China has repeatedly warned Britain to stay out of its affairs in Hong Kong.

The Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming had previously accused some British politicians of viewing Hong Kong ""as part of the British empire"".","The BNO passport is essentially a travel document that does not carry citizenship rights with it - although you are entitled to some consular assistance outside of Hong Kong and China with it.
It was issued to people in Hong Kong by the UK before Hong Kong was handed over to China.
An estimated 2.9 million people are eligible for a BNO passport, said the British Consulate General in Hong Kong.
For starters only a small percentage of people in Hong Kong currently have a BNO.

115,Covid-19 plunges Indians' study abroad dreams into turmoil,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52846214,"['Nikita', 'Bbc News Delhi']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption International students are uncertain of the future in the wake of Covid-19

Two years ago, 29-year-old Raunaq Singh started working towards his dream of pursuing an MBA from one of the world's top business schools.

In January 2020, he was waitlisted by UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business in California, and was asked to send more information to bolster his case for admission.

""So, I quit my stable job of five years and started working with a mental wellness start-up as a consultant,"" Mr Singh says.

""I'm on a major pay cut because the purpose of joining this company wasn't to earn money, but to add value to my application.""

Fortunately, he was accepted at Berkeley, and was due to start his course in September.

But then the world changed as Covid-19 spread, plunging the immediate future into uncertainty.

Mr Singh is one of hundreds of thousands of Indian students who were planning to study abroad. But now they are not quite sure what will happen given international travel restrictions, new social distancing norms and the sheer uncertainty of what the next few months will bring.

After China, India sends more students abroad to study than any other country - more than one million Indians were pursuing higher education programs overseas as of July 2019, according to India's foreign ministry.

Every year, in June and July, students flood visa centres and consulates to start the paperwork to travel and study abroad. But things look different this year.

""There's a lot of stress and anxiety and tension at this time but not enough clarity,"" says Meehika Barua, 23, who wants to study journalism in the UK.

""We don't know when international travel restrictions will be lifted or whether we'd be able to get our visas in time. We may also have to take classes online.""

Some universities across the UK and the US are giving international students the option to defer their courses to the next semester or year, while others have mandated online classes until the situation improves.

The University of Cambridge recently announced that lectures will be online only until next year. Others, like Greenwich University, will have a mix of online and face-to-face approaches while its international students can defer to the next semester.

""It feels a little unfair, especially after spending a year-and-half to get admission in one of these schools,"" Mr Singh says. ""Now, a part of the experience is compromised.""

Like him, many others are disappointed at the prospect of virtual classes.

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Cambridge University has announced that all lectures will be online

""The main reason we apply to these universities is to be able to get the experience of studying on campus or because we want to work in these countries. We want to absorb the culture there,"" Ms Barua says.

Studying abroad is also expensive. Many US and UK universities charge international students a higher fee. And then there's the additional cost of applications or standardised tests.

Virtual classes mean they don't have to pay for a visa, air tickets or living expenses. But many students are hesitant about spending their savings or borrowing money to pay for attending college in their living room.

Even if, months later, the situation improves to some extent, and students could travel abroad and enrol on campus, they say that brings its own challenges.

For one, Mr Singh points out, there is the steep cost of healthcare, and questions over access to it, as countries like the US are experiencing a deluge of infections and deaths.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Students are also unsure of finding jobs overseas after graduation

And then there are the dimming job prospects. The pandemic has squeezed the global economy, so employers are less likely to hire, or sponsor visas for foreign workers.

""For international students, the roller coaster has been more intense because there is increased uncertainty about their ability to get jobs in the US after graduation, and for some, in their ability to get to the US at all,"" says Taya Carothers, who works in Northwestern University's international student office.

The idea of returning to India with an expensive degree and the looming unemployment is scaring students - especially since for many of them, the decision to study abroad is tied to a desire to find a well-paying job there.

""The risk we take when we leave our home country and move to another country - that risk has increased manifold,"" Mr Singh adds.

The current crisis - and its economic impact - has affected the decision of nearly half the Indians who wanted to study abroad, according to a recent report by the QS, a global education network.

Experts say universities are in a tough spot too.

International students add as much as $45bn (£37bn) a year to the American economy. In the UK, universities receive almost £7bn in fees from overseas students. So their finances will take a hit if too many foreign students rethink going abroad.

And logistics will also pose a challenge - colleges have to enforce social distancing across campuses, including dormitories, and accommodate students from multiple time zones in virtual classes.

""Regardless of how good your technology is, you're still going to face problems like internet issues,"" says Sadiq Basha, who heads a study abroad consultancy.

He adds that there might be a knee-jerk reaction as a large number of international students consider deferring their admission to 2021. But he's positive that ""in the long term, the ambitions of Indian students are not going to go down.""

Mr Singh is still waiting to see how things will unfold in the next few months, but he's almost certain he will enrol and start his first semester of the two-year program online.

""Since I've been preparing for over a year now, I think mentally I'm already there,"" he says.","Mr Singh is one of hundreds of thousands of Indian students who were planning to study abroad.

116,We Are One: How the world's film festivals came together,https://bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52831699,"['Steven Mcintosh', 'Entertainment Reporter']","Image copyright ANNECY Image caption DreamWorks' animation Bilby is among the short films at the We Are One festival

A foreign language film about the social divide in South Korea wouldn't normally scream box office hit.

But after Bong Joon-ho's film Parasite won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival last May, it set it on a path to ultimately winning the best picture Oscar nine months later.

And that's the thing about film festivals - they may be industry events largely attended by critics, journalists and filmmakers, but their influence can be huge.

The buzz a movie generates at Sundance, Toronto or Venice can determine whether a distributor picks it up for a wider public release - and put it firmly on the radar of awards season.

Of course, the coronavirus pandemic has meant most of this year's festivals cannot go ahead - so they are teaming up for a 10-day online celebration, called We Are One: A Global Film Festival.

It will feature contributions from pretty much every major film festival, including Cannes, Tribeca and Berlin, as well as some of the smaller festivals which don't attract as much publicity.

""We thought, 'What could we do to help?'"" explains organiser and Tribeca CEO Jane Rosenthal.

""You have musicians, comedians and chefs that have been gathering for various relief efforts, but at a time where we're all feeling so isolated, and we're all looking for something to watch, I had this idea of bringing all the film festivals, the great curators, together.""

Image copyright Tokyo Film Festival Image caption Tremble All You Want tells the story of self-obsessed 24-year-old office worker Yoshika

Here's how it will work:

There will be one single YouTube channel, broadcasting continuously from Friday 29 May until Sunday 7 June

The programme will consist of more than 100 films, including 13 world premieres and 31 online premieres

All films will be free to watch

There will only be one chance to see certain films, as they won't remain online after their screening

It will be signposted where each film is from, and many will feature introductions from the respective festival directors

The We Are One festival, not to be confused with Lady Gaga's musical equivalent One World: Together, has been an ambitious undertaking, to say the least.

Having to co-ordinate 21 different festivals takes a lot of organisation, not to mention a video platform that can handle it.

""We wanted to programme a virtual festival using new works, old works, works that have never been seen outside of an individual country,"" Rosenthal explains. ""So we called YouTube, who were interested in the idea, we felt they were the ideal platform.""

YouTube already had the required technical infrastructure for such an event - including the ability to add translations on screen, and a ""donate"" button for charities involved in Covid-19 efforts.

""There was also their ability to put a premiere up and take it down very quickly,"" Rosenthal says, ""So if we have a film that's only up for a day, you can only see if for that day, and then it can be taken down.""

In addition to the films themselves, the channel will broadcast panel discussions recorded at previous festivals, featuring the likes of Jackie Chan, Ang Lee, Jane Campion, Guillermo del Toro, Viggo Mortensen, Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Soderbergh.

However, one imagines convincing directors to allow their film to be viewed online instead of in cinemas was not an easy task.

After all, some major releases, such as Mulan, No Time To Die and Fast & Furious 9 are holding off until cinemas reopen, because producers are so keen on a big screen release.

""Some required more conversations than others,"" Rosenthal says of selecting the films for the programme. ""It depends on the film and what the filmmaker wants.""

On the flip side, putting all the film festivals on to a single platform will arguably benefit some of the smaller festivals, who don't normally get as much publicity as the major ones like Sundance, Cannes and Toronto.

""Absolutely, it's wonderful to know what they [filmmakers] are doing out of Tokyo, Annecy, Saint Sebastian, or Mumbai, to see the creativity, how it's bringing communities together, to see the landscape of these countries,"" Rosenthal says.

While the organisational efforts involved in We Are One may be applauded, The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw doubts online film festivals are the future.

""In the end, after this is all over, people will want to go back to the flesh and blood experience, to see the films on the big screen, that sense of occasion that is the vital curatorial tool for focusing minds on a new film,"" he said.

""And people will want to talk about films: talk about them over coffee, over lunch, in the street outside the cinema. That is the festival experience.""

For the time being, online is where they will stay - several festivals are exploring whether they can go ahead digitally this year, in addition to their participation in We Are One.

While nothing will replace that real-life feeling, Rosenthal hopes to recreate some of the atmosphere you'd normally expect.

""There will be surprises, whether that's directors talking, musical surprises, we're trying to give you that sense of musical spontaneity as much as we can on a virtual screen,"" she says.

""And while we can't all queue up in a line together, and we're not able to touch each other or hear the laughing or booing, we can instigate imagination and inspiration.""

117,Crossing Divides: The bomb maker turned peacemaker,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-51907603,"['Rebecca Henschke', 'Endang Nurdin', 'Bbc World Service']","Image caption Ali Fauzi is now helping others turn their backs on extremism and intolerance

""I am an expert bomb maker. I can make bombs in just five minutes.""

Ali Fauzi was a key member of Jemaah Islamiyah, a militant group with links to al-Qaeda, which was responsible for Indonesia's worst attack - the 2002 Bali bombing that killed more than 200 people.

""My brothers carried out the Bali bombing. It was huge bomb in the heart of the island's tourist district.""

The group went on to carry out a string of bombings in Indonesia. They were deadly attacks on major hotels and Western embassies. The seemingly sleepy village of Tenggulun in Lamongan, East Java was the group's base camp.

Now Ali Fauzi's mission is very different. He works to help former jihadis leave a life of violence and to stop new recruits from joining the next wave of militant groups in South East Asia.

""The reality is that it is much easier to recruit people to terrorist groups,"" he says.

""They only have to pull a trigger and lots of people will join them but the process of deradicalisation takes time. It has to be done step by step.""

And his new mission has come at a high personal cost.

""The threats against me are intense, it's not just verbal attacks but death threats. But, honestly, I am not scared because I know what I am doing is right. I am ready and prepared to die doing this.""

It was videos of foreign wars - in Afghanistan, Bosnia and the Palestinian Territories, watched on mobile phones from their quiet Javanese village - that motivated Ali Fauzi and his brothers to join militant groups.

""We saw videos of the brutal attacks on civilians. I wanted to carry out jihad to protect the Muslim people from the bullies. With young, hot blood I wanted to fight back.""

While his brothers went to fight alongside the mujahideen, in Afghanistan, Ali Fauzi stayed closer to home, joining Islamic militants fighting for a Muslim homeland in the southern Philippines.

""I really wanted to die there. I imagined my own death all the time,"" he says.

""I believed that if I was killed in battle I would go straight to heaven and be met by angels there. That's what our mentors told us every day.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The 2002 bombings killed 202 people

When his brothers returned from Afghanistan, they put into practice what they had learnt abroad.

In October 2002, they were among a group that detonated two bombs targeting nightclubs in the Kuta area of Bali, the island popular with international tourists.

""I saw it on TV and I was shocked, there were so many dead bodies,"" says Ali Fauzi. ""It led the authorities right to us.""

Two of his brothers, Ali Ghufron and Amrozi, were executed while his third, Ali Imron, is behind bars for life.

Ali Fauzi, who insists he was not involved in the Bali bombing, spent three years in jail for other terror-related offences. That's when his life took on a dramatically new direction.

""Police treated me very humanely. If they had tortured me then maybe seven generations after me would be fighting the Indonesian government,"" he says.

""I hated the police, we thought of them as Satan. That's what we were taught. But the reality was completely different. That's when my whole perspective completely changed.""

He also met victims of bombings his group had carried out.

""I cried. My heart melted, seeing the horrific effect our bombs had. That's what made me really want to change from an agent of war to become a warrior for peace.""

As the evening call to prayer rings out across the Tenggulun village, prayer mats are rolled out in a square at the side of the village's main mosque. They are just next to the office of Circle of Peace, the foundation Ali Fauzi set up in 2016 to divert people away from extremism.

The prayer event tonight is led by two bomb victims, guests of honour in this village which was once the base camp for the militant groups that carried out the attacks that destroyed their lives.

""I often bring victims to the community,"" Ali Fauzi says, ""as meeting them was the thing that destroyed my ego.""

On the screen on the side of the stage a graphic video shows the aftermath of all the bombs in Indonesia.

It's an extraordinary meeting. In the audience are police who arrested members of this community, as well as those who have served time in jail on terrorism offences.

They are listening to the victims of the bombing talk, through tears, about the pain they have suffered.

In the audience is 33-year-old Zulia Mahendra. He was a teenager when his father, Amrozi, was arrested, sentenced to death and then later executed for the Bali bombing.

Amrozi was dubbed the ""smiling assassin"" by the media because he showed no remorse during the trial, grinning throughout and defiant to his death.

Crossing divides

A season of stories about bringing people together in a fragmented world.

After the meeting, Mahendra greets the two bomb victims. They hug and hold hands, and he repeatedly says sorry.

""I want to say sorry, not because I am wrong. But he was my father and these are the victims of my family's actions. I have a responsibility to say sorry, on behalf of my father.""

Image caption Zulia Mahendra was 16 when his father was arrested and then later executed for the Bali bombing

Mahendra, too, has gone through an astonishing transformation.

""When my father was executed, I wanted revenge. I wanted to learn how to make bombs too,"" he admits.

""But over time and with guidance from my uncles - Ali Fauzi and Ali Imron - they made me realise it was the wrong thing to do. And I joined their project to help other terrorists change.""

Image caption Zulia Mahendra with his son

""How I became who I am today was a very, very long journey,"" says Mahendra.

""But I came to a place where I understood that jihad is not killing people or fighting, it can mean working hard for your family.""

One night, Mahendra says, he looked tearfully at his sleeping child and thought about his father.

""I didn't want my child to have to go through what I have. If I continued on my father's path, my child too would be abandoned. I knew that the right jihad was to look after them - to protect them.""

But he says he has friends who have joined splinter militant groups in Indonesia, loosely linked to the Islamic State (IS) group.

""There are lots of reasons why a person goes in that direction - their economic situation, not having anything to do... what they are taught and who they are influenced by.""

Ali Fauzi knocks at the door of the Lamongan jail. This is a familiar place for him, having come here many times to meet family members serving time but also to work with new inmates to try and turn their life around.

""My deradicalisation work is not based on theory. It's from life experience. I was a fighter and a terrorist, so I come into the cells as a friend.""

But he faces resistance and is viewed by some as a traitor for working with the police.

""They say that I am even more of a kafir [unbeliever] than the police or jail guards. I regularly face online abuse and threatening phone calls. But it's okay. I can handle it,"" he says with a smile.

""Out of the 98 people we have worked with since 2016, two have come out of jail and gone straight back to their militant ways.""

""Deradicalisation is not easy because you are dealing with people's emotions and way of thinking, you have to give them the right medicine. And sometimes we get it wrong.""

Sometimes they get it right.

Sumarno, he says, is one of his success stories.

He takes me to a dry field, at the side of the road outside the village. It was here that Sumarno says he hid weapons belonging to Jemaah Islamiyah, after the Bali bombing.

Image caption Sumarno points to where he hide weapons after the 2002 Bali bombings.

After serving a three-year jail sentence, Ali Fauzi helped Sumarno set up a small business - a travel company offering pilgrimage packages to Mecca.

""Now I want to give back to society,"" says Sumarno. ""With this travel company, I hope that I can leave a life of violence behind me.""

Sitting in his smart air-conditioned office in Paciran, a 20-minute drive from the village, he says he was nervous at first about telling his clients about his violent past, even careful not to say which village he was from.

But now he starts the tour with what he calls his story of redemption.

""I say I am the cousin of Ali Gufron and Amrozi who were executed for carrying out the Bali bombings. I tell them: 'I was part of their group. But thanks be to Allah I have been healed from that rotten way of thinking. And I am your tour guide to Mecca.'""

In a room at the side of the village mosque, an after-school club takes place. Children dressed in colourful clothes recite the Koran.

Some of their parents are behind bars on terrorism charges.

The teachers include Ali Fauzi's wife, Lulu, and Zumrottin Nisa, who is married to Ali Imron.

""We stress to them that not everyone believes the same thing,"" says Lulu.

""That there are people in our community who are non-Muslim and we have to treat them with respect as long as they don't try to interfere with our faith.""

But she says they haven't convinced everyone.

""There are those for and against our new mission. Those that are still militant don't like us now. They stay away from us,"" she says.

""We used to be one group with the same mission but we changed after the Bali bombing killed so many innocent people, many of them Muslims. There are others who haven't changed.""

In May last year, a family of suicide bombers attacked three churches in East Java.

The father went after one, his teenage sons went after another, and his wife and two daughters, age 12 and nine, blew themselves up at the third.

The attackers were part of the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) network, which is loosely linked to IS.

JAD has carried out a series of lone wolf attacks against Indonesian security forces and religious minorities. The most recent was a knife attack, by a young couple, against the country's top security officer, Wiranto.

Image caption Lulu Fauzi

In the Circle of Peace office, Lulu Fauzi says she is shocked women are taking such an active part.

""My husband is working hard to make sure former terrorism inmates don't go back. He is bringing them together and he has been able to turn around many people.

""But many people are still radical. We can never really wipe it out,"" she says.

As we drive through the village, Ali Fauzi's phone is constantly ringing.

He takes a call from someone who has recently been released, having served time on terrorism charges. The person needs help getting housing.

Another call is from a mother whose son is being questioned by the police.

""Dozens of people from our community went to fight with the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq,"" he says. ""Not long ago, a member of IS was detained by the police here. So militant groups still exist and they still threaten Indonesia.""

Now he's on the side of what he describes as a battle against extremism and intolerance.

118,Coronavirus: How Turkey took control of Covid-19 emergency,https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-52831017,"['Orla Guerin', 'Bbc International Correspondent']","Image copyright EPA Image caption Turkey has a lower recorded death toll than many other countries in Europe

Covid-19 came late to Turkey - on 11 March - but soon singed every corner of the country. Within a month all 81 provinces had been affected.

It was the one of the fastest growing outbreaks in the world - worse than China or the UK. There were fears that the death toll would soar turning Turkey into another Italy, which was then the hardest hit country.

Three months on that hasn't happened, even without a total lockdown.

The official death toll is 4,397. Some doctors here dispute that, claiming the real figure could be twice as high because Turkey only includes those who test positive. Either way, in the horrific annals of the Covid-19 era, it's a relatively low number for a population of 83 million.

An unusual lockdown

Experts warn it is hard to reach conclusions and compare statistics while countries are still burying their dead. But Turkey has ""clearly averted a much bigger disaster"", according to Dr Jeremy Rossman, Lecturer in Virology at the University of Kent.

""Turkey fits in the category of several countries that responded fairly quickly with testing, tracing, isolation and movement restrictions,"" he told the BBC. ""It's a fairly small club of countries that have been quite effective in reducing the viral spread.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Turkey has not imposed a full lockdown as in other countries

As the virus multiplied, the authorities subtracted key pieces from the jigsaw of daily life - no trips to the coffee shop, no shopping in crowded markets, no communal prayers at the mosque.

The over-65s and under-20s were locked down completely, weekend curfews were imposed, and major cities were sealed off.

Istanbul was the centre of the epidemic. The city lost its rhythm, like a heart that keeps missing a beat.

How Turkey tracks the virus

Now restrictions are gradually easing, but Dr Melek Nur Aslan remains on alert. She's director of public health for the district of Fatih, a heavily populated area in the heart of old Istanbul. Dr Aslan, who is articulate, and energetic, leads a contract-tracing operation. Across Turkey there are 6,000 teams.

Image caption Dr Melek Nur Aslan says Turkey was able to start testing for the virus at the start of its outbreak

""We feel we are in a war,"" she tells me. ""People forget to go home. We say 'OK eight hours is completed' but they don't even care about going home because they know this is a duty they have to complete, before it spreads to anyone else.""

Dr Aslan says they began tracking the virus on day one - 11 March - thanks to decades of experience tracking measles. ""Those plans were ready,"" she says. ""We just got them off the shelf and started using them.""

We join two young doctors in the narrow streets of Fatih, equipped with an app, and clad in Hazmat suits. They head for an apartment block where two flatmates in their twenties have been in quarantine. Their friend is Covid-19 positive.

The women are framed in the doorway of their apartment, both in face masks, and one wearing a headscarf. They are tested on the spot for Covid-19 and will get the results within 24 hours. It's just a day since they started showing mild symptoms. Nazli Demiralp, 29, is grateful for the prompt response.

Image caption The women will get their results in 24 hours

""We follow foreign news,"" she says, ""and when we first heard about the virus we were really scared. But Turkey has rallied faster than we thought - much faster than Europe and the United States. ""

Turkey embraces hydroxychloroquine

The country has public health lessons to offer, according to acting head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Turkey, Dr Irshad Shaikh.

""Initially we were worried,"" he told the BBC. ""They were having 3,500 positive cases per day. But what has worked is testing. And they did not have to wait five or six days for results."" He also credits the quarantine, isolation and contract tracing measures but says it's too soon to judge Turkey's treatment protocol for patients.

Controversially that includes the anti-malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, as standard. It's much touted by President Donald Trump - but has been roundly rejected by the latest international research.

The WHO has temporarily suspended it from their trial of possible treatments for the virus. That followed research published in the Lancet which suggested hydroxychloroquine can cause cardiac problems in Covid-19 patients, and could do more harm than good.

We were given access to a hospital where it has been part of the standard treatment for thousands of patients. The Dr Sehit Ilhan Varank hospital, a two-year old-state hospital, is also state of the art. It's a bright, spacious battlefront against the virus.

Chief doctor Nurettin Yiyit - whose art work is on the hospital walls - says it's key to use hydroxychloroquine early. ""Other countries are using this drug too late,"" he says, ""especially the United States. We only use it at the beginning. We have no hesitation about this drug. We believe it's effective because we get the results.""

On a tour of the hospital, adding and subtracting protective layers as we go, he explains that Turkey's approach is to ""get ahead of the virus"", by treating early and treating aggressively. They use hydroxychloroquine and other drugs, along with blood plasma and oxygen in high concentrations.

Dr Yiyit is proud of his hospital's mortality rate of under 1%, and of the empty beds in the intensive care unit. They try to keep patients out of here, and off ventilators.

Not over yet

The government's handling of the pandemic has not been given a clean bill of health by the Turkish Medical Association. It says there were many mistakes in Ankara's ""inadequate"" response to the pandemic, including leaving borders open for too long.

However, Turkey is getting some credit from the WHO. ""This is a young outbreak,"" said Dr Shaikh. ""But we would expect more people to be severely sick. Something is going right.""

Turkey has advantages in the fight against Covid-19, including a young population and a high number of ICU beds. Despite this, new cases continue to be recorded, currently at the rate of about 1,000 a day.

119,What if the US removes Hong Kong's special status?,https://bbc.com/news/business-52835471,"['Vivienne', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Getty Images

Top members of the US administration have warned that Hong Kong no longer merits a special status when it comes trade, and the territory could be treated the same way as mainland China.

Until now, the US has given Hong Kong favourable trading terms, dating back to the territory's time as a British colony, but US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that Hong Kong no longer enjoys a high degree of autonomy from China.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Beijing ""will be held accountable"" for a new security law set to be imposed on Hong Kong.

The National Economic Council Director told CNBC, ""If need be, Hong Kong now may have to be treated the same way as China is treated, and that has implications for tariffs"".

So what will it mean if that special status is revoked?

Hong Kong is well-known as one of the world's most important financial centres. With a free economy and a competitive tax regime, it's attracted many multinational companies to its shores.

It's also an important hub for trade. But all of that could be in jeopardy, if the US changes the way it deals with Hong Kong.

So what is the US threatening?

At the moment, Hong Kong enjoys special trade relations with the US. It operates as a separate customs territory to mainland China. It also has a free port, meaning no tariffs are charged on the import or export of goods.

Those arrangements have helped Hong Kong become a centre for global trade. But now the US is threatening to treat Hong Kong the same as mainland China. That would mean its goods would be subject to additional tariffs, including those extra charges that were introduced as part of the US-China trade war, although some of those have recently been rolled back.

""Hong Kong has had a special trading relationship with different types of tariffs and regulations that have allowed it to trade in a freer way, particularly in relation to capital markets,"" said Dr Rebecca Harding, independent trade expert and CEO of Coriolis Technologies.

""The US has treated it as an ally, if you like. But it's now saying we are going to treat you in a similar way to how we treat China,"" she said.

Where does that leave Hong Kong?

Hong Kong is one of the world's top trading territories. In 2018 it was ranked with the 7th highest volume of trade with a total value of nearly $1.2tn.

But much of that trade is made up of goods that pass into, or come out of, mainland China.

In 2018, 8% of mainland China's exports to the US and 6% of mainland China's imports from the US, passed through Hong Kong.

This role as a gateway between the Chinese market and the rest of the world has put Hong Kong in a unique position, but different trade arrangements could change that.

Image copyright Getty Images

""If there's a new trade regime in place, that changes the calculation for companies,"" said Dr Tim Summers, a Senior Fellow at Chatham House, based in Hong Kong.

Companies could choose to move their goods directly through ports in mainland China instead, and higher tariffs there will mean higher price tags.

""The people who are going to get hurt are businesses and consumers,"" Dr Summers said.

Will China be worried?

Not so much as it might have been at the time of the Hong Kong handover. Back in 1997, Hong Kong played a much more significant role in China's economy, accounting for around 18% of China's GDP.

""But over the last 25 years China has grown massively,"" said Dr Summers. Hong Kong now contributes just 2-3% of China's GDP.

""Put that in context of the ocean of trade coming out of China, it's not so significant any more. So if President Trump were to act on trade, Hong Kong would suffer, but it's not a gamechanger for China,"" he said.

Image copyright Getty Images

Beijing will however want to maintain Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre. Mainland Chinese companies are among those which choose to list on Hong Kong's Stock Exchange because of its access to global capital. Mainland Chinese companies also benefit from Hong Kong's large financial services sector.

""Shanghai and Shenzhen already have a vibrant financial services sector serving mainlanders,"" said David Webb, a former investment banker who's lived in Hong Kong since 1991. But so long as Beijing has capital controls on the movement of money in and out of China for investment, ""then it can't compete with Hong Kong on international capital,"" he said.

How could this affect the US?

Each year, billions of dollars worth of goods and services are traded between Hong Kong and the US. In 2018, the total value of that trade was almost $67bn according to the US Trade Representative, including $17bn worth of imports that Americans bought from Hong Kong.

If Hong Kong faces the same trading terms as mainland China, US consumers will pay more for those goods.

""American businesses both in the US itself and in Hong Kong are lobbying hard to try and get any action diluted,"" said Rachel Cartland, director of Cartland Consulting and a former Hong Kong civil servant.

The US Chamber of Commerce has warned that far-reaching changes to Hong Kong's status would have ""serious implications"" for Hong Kong and US businesses.

That puts Washington in a tricky position, according Dr Summers.

He says ostensibly, Secretary Pompeo's threat appears to be about recent developments in Hong Kong, and Beijing's new security law for the territory. But he said, what it's really about is US-China relations.

""If I were going to be really cynical, I would say this has provided an opportunity for some people in Washington to take measures they wanted to take anyway against China, in the context of a wider US-China rivalry,"" he said.

""That may well drive the thinking of what Trump does next more than any particular concern about the political autonomy of Hong Kong,"" he said.","In 2018, 8% of mainland China's exports to the US and 6% of mainland China's imports from the US, passed through Hong Kong.

120,The coronavirus conundrum when your mouth is your ‘hand’,https://bbc.com/news/disability-52402482,[],"Image copyright Geoff Adams-Spink

Many disabled people face difficulties adapting their routines to stay safe during the coronavirus pandemic. Thalidomide Society chairman Geoff Adams-Spink reveals some thalidomide survivors have been left perplexed after realising how often use their mouths and feet for tasks, instead of their hands.

It was a friend and fellow thalidomide survivor, Berrisford, who first alerted me and other members of our community to the added dangers posed by coronavirus.

Thalidomide was a morning sickness drug given to pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s, but it typically caused shortening of limbs for the babies born. For both Berrisford and me, it affected our arms.

In a Facebook post for friends, Berrisford described the great lengths he had gone to in order to remain safe while out on a shopping trip just after Covid-19 hit the UK.

He explained that he meticulously swabbed his supermarket trolley and maintained social distancing at all times.

He took his goodies home in the knowledge he had kept himself safe having followed the government's guidelines. A good job well done.

At home, hungry and tempted by the food in front of him, he grabbed something that looked tasty and tore into the packet in a way he has done for most of his life - with his teeth.

Despites all of those elaborate precautions he had momentarily forgotten he often relies on his mouth instead of his hands for such tasks.

Image copyright Geoff Adams-Spink

His hygiene routine had effectively been thwarted by a rumbling stomach and a workaround that many of us with shorter arms have used several times each day for decades.

So how do you deal with coronavirus when you use your mouth for simple tasks, instead of your hands?

It surely doesn't need to be pointed out that the hand-washing principles aren't as effective for my friend or me in this situation as for many others.

But putting something in your mouth that has come from a public place could potentially transfer the virus straight to your body - it would be a very direct transmission.

Many Thalidomide survivors use the same mouth-trick as Berrisford for the sake of simplicity and speed. My dentist constantly reminds me that opening bottles with my teeth (the screw top kind, don't worry) will result in lasting damage. Correction, has already resulted in some lasting damage.

But at the moment, life with coronavirus means taking care to wash all my shopping once I return home, before I open a packet and devour the contents. Or I can ask someone within my household to help me, providing they have washed their hands first.

It's not just our mouths that can cause dilemmas. A lot has already been written about the difficulty some disabled people face in trying to maintain the 2m (6ft) distance from care givers - if somebody is washing my hair in the shower, they are in the danger zone, as am I.

Image copyright Geoff Adams-Spink Image caption Many Thalidomide survivors have learned to use their feet in place of hands

Thalidomide survivors are all around the same age - heading into our 60s - but we now face a whole new set of challenges to untangle related to this pandemic. We'll have to wait for a vaccine before we can go back to using some of our old tricks and workarounds again. In my friend's characteristically poignant words: ""We have to rewrite the 'how to' book (again)"".

This got me thinking - could there be an upside, as well as a downside, to living with upper limb impairment?

Although we do use our mouths and our chins a lot, perhaps to guide a pen or maybe to open a packet of crisps, many of us are extremely adept at using our feet to do things at waist level or below.

For example, I will automatically open and close doors or flush the toilet using my feet, which don't go anywhere near my face or mouth. And at the end of the day, those socks go into the wash.

Image copyright NEIL HALL Image caption No toilet roll, no problem

When I saw videos of people fighting over toilet rolls, forgive me, but I felt a little bit smug.

In common with many other thalidomide survivors who have short arms, I have used a bidet or shower toilet since childhood - I even have a portable one for use while travelling.

We are therefore among the very few people who have not had to stress about toilet paper being in short supply.

It's all too easy to think yourself into a passive, victim mentality when it comes to coronavirus but disabled people are ingenious problem solvers - life hacks are what we do all the time to get by.

Living through this extraordinary episode will call for vast reserves of lateral thinking, creativity and ingenuity. As disabled people, we already have those things in spades.

121,"Amazon under threat: Fires, loggers and now virus",https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-51300515,"['Camilla Costa', 'Visual Journalism Americas']","So what is driving deforestation in each of the Amazon nations, how much primary forest have they lost and what are their governments doing?

""People have no idea what it would mean to lose this magnificent hydrological system.""

Antonio Nobre says: ""The ring made by central-southern Brazil and the River Plate basin would be a desert if it wasn't for the Amazon.

It affects the ecosystem of the whole region, including those who are not part of the Amazon itself, and beyond.

More than 33 million people live in the Amazon - about 8% of the population of South America - in towns, cities, riverside communities and indigenous villages. There are at least 100 tribes who have had little or no contact with outsiders.

Deforestation and its causes are a major source of friction between the governments of the nine Amazon nations, environmentalists, companies and indigenous groups: the desire for economic development clashes, in the main, with the preservation of the Amazon and its native peoples .

That doesn't seem an easy task in the near future.

""If we could restore 60,000 or 70,000 sq km in this large area, where the dry season is already much longer, we could help the forest get back to working better and it would be more resilient.""

""First, we should adopt a zero deforestation policy in Panamazonas, immediately, together with a reforestation programme in the south, south-east and east of the Amazon, which are the most vulnerable areas.""

According to Carlos Nobre, there is a way.

""Replacing the rainforest with another ecosystem, this increase could be even greater or could happen sooner.""

""Even if the conditions we have at the moment stay the same, temperatures in the Amazon region could increase by 8C, taking into account deforestation and global warming by 2070.

And temperature increases could lead to more heat-related cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, says Beatriz Oliveira, from Brazil's Climate Change Investigations Network (Red-Clima).

The process of degradation could make the insects look for other sources of food and get closer to urban settlements.

Some studies link deforestation to an increase in illnesses transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria and leishmaniasis.

This could have a catastrophic impact on the local economy. Less rain and higher temperatures mean less water for animals or growing crops like soya.

But Brazilian climatologist Carlos Nobre, says temperatures in the region could increase by 1.5-3C in the areas which become degraded savannahs. And that is without taking into account possible increases already caused by global warming.

Scientists can't say exactly what a sudden transformation of the Amazon rainforest would mean.

This means it could be even closer than they think. But what could happen after the tipping point?

The projection, however, still does not take into account degradation because of the difficulty of measuring it across Panamazonas - the joint Amazon biome across the different national borders.

It would cause the length of the dry season and temperatures in the forest to increase. Trees would start to die and the tropical rainforest could become more like a dry savannah.

This will happen when total deforestation reaches between 20% and 25% - and that could happen in the next 20 or 30 years.

We could be dangerously close to what scientists call ""the tipping point"" - when the nature of the Amazon will completely change.

If deforestation and degradation continue at current levels, the Amazon could stop working as a tropical ecosystem, even if some of it is still standing.

Among the Amazon countries, only Brazil regularly publishes annual degradation figures. However, scientists from across the region are trying to produce the relevant data to form a wider picture of the current state of the forest.

""It is a difficult phenomenon to measure because although you can see degradation on satellite images, you need to have data from the ground to understand the real picture - whether that area is more or less degraded or is recovering,"" says Alexander Lees.

So why don't they talk about degradation when measuring forest loss in the Amazon?

A recent report by the Colombian government confirms that between 2012 and 2015, its own Amazon region lost 187,955 hectares of forest to deforestation and 414,605 hectares to degradation - more than double.

Dr Nobre says the degraded areas of the Amazon are nearly twice as big as the deforested areas.

If we take the deforestation and degradation together, more than 50% of the Amazon no longer performs environmental services for the region's climate, says Antonio Nobre.

Degradation also makes the forest less efficient. It loses, for example, the ability to generate some of its own rain.

And in seven of the nine Amazon countries, they say, degradation is the main source of their carbon dioxide emissions.

Scientists also warn that degradation is an important factor in releasing stored CO2. A new study by Raisg says 47% of all the emissions in the Amazon are as a result of degradation.

""Even though not all the vegetation is lost, the soil is drier and more fragile. This changes the microclimate of the forest and makes it easier for fires to spread because the soil heats up faster,"" explains Dr Alexander Lees, Senior Lecturer in tropical ecology at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK.

This phenomenon is as much the result of climatic events - such as drought, as human action - such as burning or illegal logging which strip the forest of its vital functions. However, seen from above, it may seem that the forest is still standing.

Experts like Antonio Nobre believe that deforestation does not show the full picture of what is being lost and we should also take into account ""degradation"".

A recent study claimed that 20% of the Amazon is already emitting more CO2 that it absorbs.

For this reason, scientists fear that the Amazon will stop being a carbon store and will instead become a serious emitter of CO2, accelerating the effects of climate change.

One of the direct effects of deforestation is that it releases CO2 stored in the forest. Forest fires or the decomposition of felled trees both transform the carbon within the tree back into gas.

According to Dr Berenguer, a large tree (with at least three metres circumference) can contain between three and four tonnes of carbon. This is the same as about 10 to 12 tonnes of CO2, or what a family car emits over four years.

The older and larger the tree, the more carbon it stores.

A small part of the CO2 absorbed by trees during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere during respiration. The rest is transformed into carbon which the trees use to produce the sugars needed for their metabolism.

Primary forest is home to trees that can be hundreds or even thousands of years old. They perform a powerful role in mitigating the effects of climate change, as they act as an enormous carbon dioxide store.

In the last 10 years, figures for primary forest loss have remained high or spiked in most of the Amazon nations.

""Each hectare deforested means part of the ecosystem ceases to function and this affects the rest,"" says Oxford University rainforest expert Erika Berenguer.

This may seem insignificant - only 0.32% of the forest in the whole Amazon biome - but it is also a question of quality.

A football pitch is frequently used as a reference because, according to Fifa, the maximum size of a pitch is 1.08 hectares. However, some countries use smaller dimensions, which is why deforestation calculations can vary so much.

Almost half of this was primary forest - 1.7 million hectares of forest that was still in its original state and rich in biodiversity. Its destruction was the same as three football pitches of virgin forest being destroyed every minute in 2018.

In 2018 alone, the tree cover loss in the Amazon reached four million hectares (40,000 sq km), according to Global Forest Watch.

The most common way of measuring deforestation is ""tree cover loss"" - where forest vegetation has been completely erased.

Scientists say that if we don't reverse current levels of deforestation and degradation, the consequences of climate change could accelerate.

Even if an area does not lose all its trees and vegetation, degradation strips the rainforest of properties that are vital to the planet.

This happens when a combination of pressures on a stretch of forest - such as fires, logging or unlicensed hunting - make it hard for the ecosystem to function properly.

To get a more complete sense of the scale of the destruction, Dr Nobre says it is necessary to take into account the figures for degradation.

""The destruction of the Amazon rainforest up till now is much bigger than the almost 20% that they talk of in the media.""

""To only speak of deforestation when we refer to the loss of the Amazon is what I call ""the great green lie"","" says climate scientist Antonio Donato Nobre.

But that is not the only problem.

Brazil and Bolivia were among the top five countries for loss of primary forest in 2018 and both saw a dramatic increase in wildfires last year.

Even before this year’s spike in deforestation, the rate across the nine Amazon countries had continued to rise.

The Brazilian authorities are deploying troops in the Amazon region to help protect the rainforest, tackle illegal deforestation and forest fires. But critics say that the government’s rhetoric and policies could actually be encouraging loggers and illegal miners.

Last year, an unprecedented number of fires devastated huge swathes of forest in the Amazon. Peak fire season is from July which some experts worry could coincide with the peak of the coronavirus crisis.

In April, as the number of cases rose and states started adopting isolation measures, deforestation actually increased 64% compared with the same month in 2019, according to preliminary satellite data from space research agency INPE.

But many of the field agents working to protect reserves have pulled out, Jonathan Mazower, of Survival International, says, allowing loggers and miners to target these areas.

As elsewhere, social distancing and travel restrictions have been imposed to limit the spread of the virus.

Since coronavirus spread to Brazil, in March, Amazonas has been the state to register Brazil's highest infection rates - it also has one of the most underfunded health systems in the country.

The largest and most diverse tropical rainforest in the world is home to 33 million people and thousands of species of plants and animals.

Here, we look at the pressures pushing the Amazon to the brink and ask what the nine countries that share this unique natural resource are doing to protect it.

Deforestation, illegal mining, land clearances and wildfires were already at an 11-year high and scientists say we're fast approaching a point of no return - after which the Amazon will no longer function as it should.

Deforestation jumped 55% in the first four months of 2020 compared with the same period last year, as people have taken advantage of the crisis to carry out illegal clearances.

The Amazon rainforest - which plays a vital role in balancing the world's climate and helping fight global warming - is also suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The fires which started in Bolivia in May 2019 destroyed almost two million hectares of forest, according to the Friends of Nature monitoring NGO.

Half of that was in protected areas, known for their wide biodiversity.

Environmentalists say Evo Morales' government has promoted deforestation with policies of selling land in the Amazon region to businessmen and distributing it to farmers.

The expansion of the farming frontier is mainly to encourage soya planting and cattle raising, in the hope of building exports for the Chinese market. In August 2019, Mr Morales celebrated the first beef exports to China from Santa Cruz.

The same region was responsible for nearly half of Bolivia's soya production in 2018 and was most affected by the fires last year.

In response to criticism during the fires crisis, Morales halted land sales in Santa Cruz for what he called ""an ecological pause"".

We asked the Bolivian environment ministry about its strategy to reduce deforestation, but have had no response.

But the loss of forest has once again started to rise.

In November 2019, the government published data confirming expert predictions: that between the middle of 2018 and the middle of 2019, deforestation in the Amazon had increased 30% in relation to the previous year.

They had cleared around 980,000 hectares (9,800 sq km), the largest area of forest cut down since 2008.

And these figures don't take into account August 2019, when Amazon fires were at their worst.

President Jair Bolsonaro's government claimed the fires were down to the dry season. But investigations by IPAM and the Federal University of Acre found otherwise.

According to their report, the Amazon fires are directly related to deforestation.

""After felling the trees, they leave it to dry for a few months then set fire to it to clear the vegetation. The land is then used to plant grass and create pastures,"" says Erika Berenguer.

According to the FAO, 80% of tree loss in Brazil is directly or indirectly related to cattle farming. Brazil is the largest beef exporter in the world. It makes up 7% of the country's GDP and 4.6% of exports.

Today, around 40% of the country's cattle is raised in Amazon states. But that is only part of the story.

Around 60 million hectares of the Brazilian Amazon are considered public areas, or rather they have no legal purpose defined by the government.

They are not conservation areas, nor indigenous territories, for example. People clear this land, cut the trees down and put cattle on them, it's the cheapest way to occupy them, says Stabile.

A patch of land without trees is worth more on the market.

The primary use of deforested land in Brazil is cattle. But the aim is not necessarily to earn money from meat production but from the sale of land Marcelo Stabile, of IPAM, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute

The next step in the chain is to illegally obtain a title deed for the land and sell it, says Mr Stabile. They then find another patch of forest and start again. The land is often sold to large-scale farmers and it is hard to tell which was cleared legally and what wasn't.

The same happens in Colombia, Peru and Ecuador.

According to Mr Stabile and other investigators, Brazil could double or triple its number of cattle without felling another hectare of the Amazon rainforest.

""What's happening is land speculation,"" he says. ""If the government defined these public areas, it would cease to be lucrative.""

Environmentalists and investigators say statements and policies from Bolsonaro's government are encouraging clearances and the persecution of indigenous people.

Although the government denies this, the president has said he wants to end the ""industry of environmental taxes"" and believes the country has too many conservation areas. The government also wants to allow mining on land belonging to indigenous tribes.

Between January and September 2019, attacks and invasions of indigenous people's land increased 40% on the previous year. The finger of blame is pointed at those involved in land clearance, logging and mining.

However, as the coronavirus crisis took hold in May, around 4,000 troops were mobilised in the Amazon against illegal logging and other activities until June, although that could be extended into the dry season to help with fire prevention.

Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said the coronavirus outbreak had ""aggravated"" the situation this year.

President Bolsonaro, however, has spoken against punitive measures taken against loggers and miners - such as the destruction of their equipment when it can't be taken out of the forest. Critics say that sends a message that the government is on their side.

Colombia Amazon area: 48.5 million hectares Primary forest lost: 11.7%

In 2017, the level of deforestation in Colombia was one of the biggest in the Amazon region and the highest in the country's history. More than 140,000 hectares of forest was cleared, twice the previous year's total.

This peak was a result of the peace accord with Farc rebels in 2016, which left a power vacuum in forested areas.

Community leaders said Farc had acted as a type of environmental police, controlling when farmers were allowed to clear the forest or burn for agriculture or cattle farming.

""Government officials wouldn't come near the Amazon region because of Farc, who, for their own protection, had an interest in keeping the trees standing. So the rebels could establish strict rules,"" said Rodrigo Botero, director of Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development.

However, Colombia is now facing a race to clear land in the Amazon led by large-scale farmers, local authorities, drug dealers and other paramilitary groups such as the ELN, says Botero.

There is a market for land and the government can't stop it, he says.

The Colombian government formed a National Council for the Fight against Deforestation in an attempt to tackle the issue.

The group works to identify pockets of deforestation, the causes and what action is needed, according to the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development.

Laws passed in 2018 made the protection of water, biodiversity and the environment priority issues in matters of national security. The government can now intervene to protect areas in the Amazon national park from illegal activities.

They are also carrying out military operations against people clearing land and launching programmes which promote financial incentives for conservation.

But in 2018, deforestation rates only fell by 4%. By 2018, Colombian had lost around 11.7% of its original forest - 14% of which was in the last eight years.

Ecuador Amazon area: 10.3 million hectares Primary forest lost: 10%

In the north of Ecuador, palm oil production is the main threat to the Amazon, experts say.

The oil is used worldwide in the industrialised production of food such as chocolate, cosmetics, cleaning products and fuels.

Ecuador is the second biggest producer of palm oil in Latin America, and the sixth worldwide.

The expansion of palm oil and cocoa plantations in the last 10 years is the main driver of deforestation, according to Global Forest Watch and Maap.

This is particularly worrying because despite only covering about 2% of the Amazon biome, Ecuador has one of the most diverse parts of the forest. In just one hectare of the Yasuní park area, you'll find 670 tree species - more than in the whole of North America.

Furthermore, according to a study by the country's National Institute of Biodiversity, between 40% and 60% of the species of trees in Ecuador's Amazon region are still unknown.

Mining boom

Mining projects and oil exploration in the Amazon have also made headline news in Ecuador.

One such project is Mirador, an open mine for copper, gold and silver which will be built in two Amazon provinces. It is the biggest project of its type in Ecuador - but not the only one.

The government says industrial mining in the region, carried out by a Chinese company, will be responsible and the income generated will allow investment in infrastructure locally.

However, investigators believe the activity could bring with it serious problems to the Amazon.

""As well as deforestation, we don't know exactly where they are going to put the dams nor how they are going to monitor them,"" said Carmen Josse, scientific director of the EcoScience Foundation.

They are rugged areas with a lot of biodiversity. We don't want an accident like Brumadinho, in Brazil Carmen Josse, EcoScience Foundation

At the start of 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron suspended a gold mining megaproject within the Guianan Amazon National Park, which he had initially approved at the start of his tenure. The suspension was the result of national and international campaigns.

Despite this, illegal mining is the main threat to the park. Security forces have detected an increase in the number of illegal mines in the area since 2017.

With a population of less than 300,000 people, French Guiana has between 8,000 and 10,000 illegal miners. The rising price of gold since the 2008 financial crisis has sparked a rush to find the metal in the forests of the world.

Guyana Amazon area: 21.1 million hectares Primary forest lost:1%

Ninety five per cent of Guyana is covered by the Amazon.

The country proposes two ways of treating the forest which, for many, seem irreconcilable. On the one hand, it is looking for a way of exploiting it economically while at the same time selling itself as a Green State that protects the Amazon.

The annual rate of deforestation in Guyana is the lowest in the region - 0.051% in 2018, according to government figures.

Part of its success is due to strategies such as the creation of a forest management commission, which decides which trees can or cannot be cut down.

However, legal felling controlled by the government is still considered a factor that enables deforestation. According to environmentalists, licences for large international logging companies create access to virgin forest which illegal miners take advantage of.

Guyana's Forestry Commission says it has not opened any new areas of the forest for legal felling since 2015.

In fact, some areas were taken back off the companies who had licences to exploit them and they have become conservation areas, the government said.

Illegal mining - mainly gold - is to blame for 85% of the forest loss, according to the Forestry Commission. Gold is the country's main export.

The government says it has a ""Green State development strategy"" for the country which includes more investment in ecotourism and renewable energy, stricter limits on CO2 emissions and increasing forest conservation.

All this is funded by international agreements to preserve the Amazon and the discovery of huge oil reserves at sea.

Small scale agriculture has traditionally been the main cause of deforestation in Peru. Recently, however, cultivation of palm oil, cocoa and coca are catching up.

A 2018 study found that despite making up only 4% of crops in the Amazon, palm oil was responsible for 11% of deforestation between 2007 and 2013. The oil is used worldwide to produce food, cosmetics and fuel.

After some palm oil producers were fined for deforestation, they started to buy land from small farmers who had already cleared the forest illegally, says Sandra Rios, geographical engineer with the Instituto de Bien Comun (IBC Peru).

The State is slow in creating ways of monitoring, controlling and punishing deforestation by these and other means Sandra Ríos, IBC Peru

We have asked Peru's environment minister about their strategy to prevent deforestation - but they have not responded.

Illegal gold mining poses an increasing risk to the Peruvian Amazon. Peru is the biggest exporter of gold in Latin America, and the sixth worldwide. However, experts say up to 25% of its annual production comes from illegal mining.

Since 2006, Peru has been experiencing a new gold rush in the Tambopata Nature Reserve, one of the most biodiverse in the region, driven by rising gold prices and the construction of the Brazil-Peru Transoceanic Highway.

The road, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic, not only makes travelling easier, it also opens up previously inaccessible areas of the forest. The group of miners in the area, known as the La Pampa, has grown to have more than 5,000 members.

The miners strip the vegetation from the Amazon soil to look for gold. They use mercury to separate the precious metal from others, poisoning the waters and local animals in the process.

In 2017, the loss of forest as a result of mining reached its highest level since 1985, according to the Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation (Cincia).

Most illegal mining takes place in remote areas of the forest, far from the authorities. It is believed that up to 60% of the gold miners in Suriname are Brazilians who cross the border illegally.

In some of the larger areas belong to indigenous tribes or descendents of slaves, mining has become the main source of income for families.

There are no current official figures available for deforestation in Venezuela, but monitoring by local and international scientists show forest loss has increased in the last few years - especially since the creation of the Orinoco Mining Arc.

With the dramatic fall in oil prices and production in Venezuela since 2014, the Maduro government has focused its attention at states rich in minerals - such as the Amazon.

Venezuela has the sixth largest natural gold reserve in the world, with around 7,000 tonnes.

The mining arc, created in 2016, allowed licences for mining precious metals such as gold, diamonds and coltan (a combination of columbite and tantalite used in the production of mobile phones) across an area of 112,000 sq km, about 12% of the country.

The area also covers natural landmarks, forest reserves, an Amazon national park and at least four designated indigenous territories.

""The Orinoco zone is traditionally a mining area, even the indigenous people did it,"" says ecologist Peláez, from the NGO Provita.

""But the law, in some ways, legalised forms of mining that were already in place and did not help reduce activity. This has had an enormous impact on the environment and the local population.""

Maduro's plan was to grant concessions to foreign mining companies which would have to form businesses together with state-owned companies in order to operate in the area.

In practice, according to Mr Peláez, this resulted in an exponential growth in small-scale mining.

In 2018 alone, according to the Central Bank of Venezuela, the state bought 9.2 tonnes of gold on the internal market - the same as the total amount for 2011-2017.

It's having a devastating effect on the region.

""The gold that is there is of very poor quality, it's dirty,"" says Mr Peláez. ""The amount that is coming out of the ground is very small.""

People are destroying the forest and digging wherever they can. They're leaving sterile sand where nothing can grow. The deforestation in this zone is irreversible Carlos Peláez, Provita

Mining is producing tonnes of sediment that is accumulating in the country's main rivers. The use of mercury to separate gold from impurities, is poisoning rivers and indigenous people.

Venezuela has the most illegal mines in the Amazon, according to a study by Raisg. There are 1,899 illegal mines, concentrated in the Orinoco mining arc.

In the midst of Venezuela's political crisis, the National Assembly tried to repeal the law that created the Orinoco Mining Arc and even labelled it ""ecocide"" or a crime against the environment.

We've asked three government ministries about the strategy to reduce deforestation in the zone, but none have responded.","In the last 10 years, figures for primary forest loss have remained high or spiked in most of the Amazon nations.

Twitter has hidden one of President Donald Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.

But instead of being deleted, it has been replaced with a warning and can be viewed by clicking on it.

The warning says ""Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.""

It is the latest in an escalating row between Twitter and the White House.

Mr Trump was tweeting about the US city of Minneapolis, which has seen consecutive nights of protests following the death of a black man in police custody.

Image copyright Twitter Image caption Users have to press the View button to be able to see the President's tweet

The president said he would ""send in the National Guard"", and followed that up with a warning that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""

That second tweet was hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"".

Twitter's policy of adding a warning to, rather than deleting, tweets that break its rules when it comes to major public figures was announced in mid-2019. But the social network has never used it on Mr Trump - nor deleted any of his tweets before.

""This is the bravest and riskiest thing I've ever seen Twitter - or any social media giant - do,"" said Carl Miller, from the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at UK-based think-tank Demos.

""This pours rocket fuel over the online-harm-versus-free-speech debate. Online content policy doesn't get more incendiary than this.""

The same post remains unaltered on Facebook, without any warning attached.

For years Twitter resisted calls to treat Donald Trump like any other user and make him follow its rules. Then, on Wednesday, it made a first small move, not removing a tweet but adding a fact-checking link.

The company then had two choices - hunker down and weather the storm or continue to take action in accordance with its stated rules. It has now chosen the latter course of action, calling the President out for glorifying violence.

Any other user would have had their tweet removed, and might have seen their account suspended.

It now looks as though there is no easy way out for either of the two adversaries - a huge battle over the limits of free speech and the rights of social media firms to moderate content is looming.

The move means that other users will not be able to like, reply, or retweet it, Twitter said - but would still be able to retweet with a comment attached.

In a Twitter thread, the social network said: ""This tweet violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.""

The ""historical context"" is a reference to the late 1960s, when the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" was coined by Miami Police Chief Walter Headley, in reference to his aggressive policing policies in black neighbourhoods.

""We've taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.""

It comes hours after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms.

Earlier this week, Twitter used its fact-checking function to attach warnings to the president's tweets for the first time. That led the President to threaten to ""shut down"" the social networks over allegedly stifling free speech.

The executive order signed by Mr Trump has no immediate effect on the social networks, however - it instead begins a lengthy process that may result in changes down the line.","Image copyright Getty ImagesTwitter has hidden one of President Donald Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.

124,George Floyd: Protesters set Minneapolis police station ablaze,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52844192,[],"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The 3rd Precinct police station in Minneapolis was overrun by protesters and set alight

A police station in Minneapolis has been set alight during a third night of protests over the death of an unarmed black man in custody on Monday.

A police officer was filmed kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, 46, despite him saying he could not breathe.

President Donald Trump said ""thugs"" were dishonouring his memory and called on the National Guard to restore order.

Twitter accused Mr Trump of glorifying violence in a post that said: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts.""

Mr Floyd's family have demanded that the four police officers implicated in his death face murder charges. Prosecutors have said they are still gathering evidence.

The incident has added to longstanding anger over the police killings of black Americans, including the recent case of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky.

There have also been demonstrations in other US cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix and Memphis.

What happened on Thursday night?

The last few days have seen buildings in Minneapolis burned to the ground or looted.

On Thursday, protesters gathered outside the police department's 3rd Precinct, which is near where Mr Floyd died and has been the epicentre of the unrest.

Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse the crowd. But the cordon around the police station was eventually breached by protesters, who set fire to it and two other nearby buildings as the officers withdrew.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption George Floyd's death has reignited criticism of the way black Americans are treated by the police

The police department said the 3rd Precinct was evacuated shortly after 22:00 ""in the interest of the safety of our personnel"".

Later, the city government tweeted that it had heard ""unconfirmed reports that gas lines to the 3rd Precinct have been cut and other explosives materials are in the building"". It urged people near the building to retreat for their own safety.

At a news conference early on Friday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said there had been no choice but to evacuate the police station.

""The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life, of our officers or the public. We could not risk serious injury to anyone and we will continue to patrol the 3rd Precinct entirely.""

Mr Frey called the rioting and looting ""unacceptable"", but he added that he and everyone else recognised there was ""a lot of pain and anger"" in the city.

He spoke after a tweet from President Donald Trump blamed Thursday's violence on a ""lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis and warned that he would send in the National Guard and ""get the job done right"" if Mr Frey failed to restore order.

National Guard personnel are normally under state control, although they can be put under federal control in emergencies.

Mr Trump also tweeted: ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""

Twitter subsequently placed a ""public interest notice"" on the message.

The company said it ""violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today"". It added that it did not remove the tweet ""given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance"".

Twitter flagged two of the president's posts as potentially misleading earlier this week, prompting him to issue an executive order seeking to limit the legal immunity of social media firms.

Before the police station was set ablaze, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz had activated the state's National Guard troops at the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and the neighbouring city of St Paul, declaring the situation a ""peacetime emergency"".

He said the looting, vandalism and arson of Wednesday night had resulted in damage to many businesses, including ones owned by minorities.

""George Floyd's death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,"" he said in a statement, calling on all protests to remain peaceful.

The protests began on Tuesday afternoon, when hundreds of people came to the intersection where the incident had taken place.

Organisers tried to keep the protest peaceful and maintain coronavirus social distancing, with demonstrators chanting ""I can't breathe"" and ""It could've been me"".

During the second night of demonstrations on Wednesday, the crowd grew into the thousands, with protesters pelting police with stones and throwing back some throwing tear-gas canisters.

There was a stand-off outside the 3rd Precinct, where officers formed a barricade to prevent protesters gaining entry.

What has been the reaction?

Mayor Frey called on Wednesday for criminal charges to filed against the policeman who was filmed pinning down Mr Floyd. The officer and three others involved in the arrest have already been fired.

Mr Floyd's brother, Philonise, told CNN on Thursday: ""I'm never gonna get my brother back,"" he said. ""We need justice.""

Speaking through tears, he said the officers who ""executed my brother in broad daylight"" must be arrested and that he was ""tired of seeing black men die"".

United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has also condemned Mr Floyd's death, saying the role of ""entrenched and pervasive racial discrimination"" must be recognised and dealt with.

She called for protesters to act peacefully, and for police to ""take utmost care not to inflame the current situation even more"".

President Donald Trump ""was very upset"" when he saw the footage of Mr Floyd's death, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Thursday. ""He wants justice to be served,"" added.

A number of celebrities and athletes, including John Boyega, LeBron James, Beyonce, and Justin Bieber, have also expressed outrage over the incident.

The incident echoes the case of Eric Garner, who was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014. His death became a rallying cry against police brutality and a catalyst in the Black Lives Matter movement.

What happened to George Floyd?

Officers responding to reports of the use of counterfeit money approached Mr Floyd in his vehicle on Monday.

According to police, he was told to step away from the car, physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. The police statement noted his apparent ""medical distress"".

Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started.

Local media have named Mr Chauvin as the officer seen with his knee on Mr Floyd's neck.

The Minneapolis Police Officers Federation said the officers were co-operating with the investigation. ""We must review all video. We must wait for the medical examiner's report,"" it said in a statement.

In a sex fantasy gone wrong, two men with machetes entered the wrong house in New South Wales, Australia, before quickly realising their error.

One of them has now been acquitted of entering a home armed with a weapon in July 2019, Australian media report.

They had been hired to carry out a client's fantasy of being tied up in his underwear and stroked with a broom.

The judge concluded that ""the facts of the case are unusual"".

The role play was arranged over Facebook by a man near Griffith, New South Wales, who provided his address to the hired pair.

""He was willing to pay A$5,000 if it was 'really good',"" the judge said.

However, the client moved to another address 50km (30 miles) away without updating the two men. They then entered a home on the street of the original address.

When the resident noticed a light on in his kitchen at 06:15, he assumed it was a friend who came by daily to make morning coffee.

When the men called out the name of their client, the resident turned on the light and removed a sleep apnoea mask he was wearing.

It was then that he saw them standing above his bed with the machetes, which they appeared to have brought as props for the role play.

When they realised their error, one of the pair said, ""Sorry, mate"", and shook the resident's hand, according to local reports.

The two men then drove to the correct address, where the client noticed one man had a ""great big knife"" in his trousers and asked them to leave the weapons in their car.

The client then cooked bacon, eggs and noodles, and a short time later, the police arrived at the property, found the machetes in the car and arrested the hired pair.

The judge ruled that evidence did not suggest the men's actions were intentional.

""They carried the machetes either as a prop or something to use in that fantasy,"" he said. ""The fantasy was unscripted and there was discretion as to how it would be carried out.""

128,Trump signs executive order targeting Twitter after fact-checking row,https://bbc.com/news/technology-52843986,[],"Image copyright AFP

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms.

He said the firms had ""unchecked power"" to censure and edit the views of users.

President Trump has regularly accused platforms such as Twitter and Facebook of stifling conservative voices.

The order, which is expected to face legal challenges, comes after Twitter decided to append fact-check labels to two of his tweets this week.

On Wednesday Mr Trump accused the company of election interference after it added a warning label to the tweets about claims of widespread fraud in mail-in voting - also known as postal votes.

Twitter and other social media platforms strongly condemned the executive order.

And early on Friday, Twitter hid one of President Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.

What does the executive order say?

Under a 1996 law, website operators, unlike traditional publishers, cannot generally be held responsible for content posted by users.

The sites are also protected from lawsuits if they block posts deemed obscene, violent ""or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected"".

The executive order argues that this immunity should no longer apply if a social network edits posts, such as by adding a warning or a label.

It also says ""deceptive"" blocking, including removing a post for reasons other than those described in a website's terms of service, should not be protected.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio is among those arguing that the platforms take on the role of a ""publisher"" when they add fact-check labels to posts.

""The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers,"" Mr Rubio said.

""But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher, then they should no longer be shielded from liability.""

The executive order also calls for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to spell out what type of content blocking will be considered deceptive or inconsistent with a service provider's terms and conditions.

What effect will the order have?

Donald Trump promised ""big action"" in response to Twitter's decision to append a fact-check message to two of his posts. While his announcement of an executive order was heavy on rhetoric - accusing social media companies of being monopolies that threaten free speech - it will be a long process before the talk turns into real action, big or otherwise.

Independent government agencies will have to review federal law, promulgate new regulations, vote on them and then - in all likelihood - defend them in court. By the time it's all over, the November presidential election could have come and gone.

That explains why Trump is also pushing for new congressional legislation - a more straightforward way of changing US policy toward social media companies.

The real purpose of the president's order, however, may be symbolic. At the very least, the move will cause Twitter to think twice about attempting to moderate or fact-check his posts on their service.

The president relies on Twitter to get his message out without filtering from the mainstream media. If Twitter itself start blunting one of his favourite communication tools, he is sending a message that he will push back - and make things, at a minimum, uncomfortable for the company.

How have the social networks responded?

Twitter called the order ""a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law,"" adding that Section 230 ""protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it's underpinned by democratic values"".

Google, which owns YouTube, said changing Section 230 would ""hurt America's economy and its global leadership on internet freedom.""

""Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences,"" the firm said in a statement to the BBC.

In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship.

""I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,"" said Mr Zuckerberg.

What sparked the latest row?

The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social media companies flared up again on Tuesday, when two of his posts were given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time.

He had tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is no way (zero) that mail-in ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""

Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page describing the claims as ""unsubstantiated"".

Then on Wednesday, Mr Trump threatened to ""strongly regulate"" social-media platforms.

He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"", and that he would not allow this to happen.

In an earlier tweet, he said Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".

Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.""

Twitter has tightened its policies in recent years, as it faced criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.","Image copyright AFPUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms.

129,UK could offer 'path to citizenship' for Hong Kong's British passport holders,https://bbc.com/news/uk-52842303,[],"Image copyright AFP Image caption Beijing's proposed security law has sparked protests in Hong Kong

The UK could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to UK citizenship if China does not suspend plans for a security law in the territory, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says.

It comes after China's parliament backed proposal that would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority.

There are fears the legislation could end Hong Kong's unique status.

China said it reserved the right to take ""countermeasures"" against the UK.

Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the UK and China had agreed that holders of British National (Overseas) - or BNO - passport should not enjoy UK residency.

""All such BNO passport holders are Chinese nationals and if the UK insists on changing this practice it will not only violate its own stance but also international law,"" he added.

There are 300,000 BNO passport holders in Hong Kong who have the right to visit the UK for up to six months without a visa.

Mr Raab's statement came after the UK, US, Australia and Canada issued joint condemnation of Beijing's plan, saying imposing the security law would undermine the ""one country, two systems"" framework agreed before Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.

The framework guaranteed Hong Kong some autonomy and afforded rights and freedoms that do not exist in mainland China.

China has rejected foreign criticism of the proposed law, which could be in force as early as the end of June.

Li Zhanshu, chairman of the parliamentary committee that will now draft the law, said it was ""in line with the fundamental interests of all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots"".

What did Raab say?

British National (Overseas) passports were issued to people in Hong Kong by the UK before the transfer of the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.

Announcing the possible change in policy, Mr Raab said the six-month limit on stays in the UK for BNO holders would be scrapped.

""If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation, we will remove that six month limit and allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship,"" he said.

The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale says that in Beijing might not mind if some pro-democracy campaigners escape to the UK, but the flight of talented wealth creators would be of concern.

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Mr Raab says time limits on visits by Hong Kong BNO holders could be scrapped

Some MPs want the UK to go further and offer automatic citizenship. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said BNO holders should have an automatic right to live and work in the UK.

The government has in the past rejected calls to give BNO holders in Hong Kong full citizenship.

Last year more than 100,000 people in Hong Kong signed a petition calling for full rights. The government responded by saying that only UK citizens and certain Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK and cited a 2007 review which said giving BNO holders full citizenship would be a breach of the agreement under which the UK handed Hong Kong back to China.

However in 1972 the UK offered asylum to some 30,000 Ugandan Asians with British Overseas passports after the then-military ruler Idi Amin ordered about 60,000 Asians to leave. At the time some MPs said India should take responsibility for the refugees, but Prime Minister Edward Heath said the UK had a duty to accept them.

What other reaction has there been?

Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy earlier said the UK had to be more robust with Beijing.

Referring to the security law, she told the BBC: ""This is the latest in a series of attempts by China to start to erode the joint declaration which Britain co-signed with the Chinese government when we handed over Hong Kong, and protected its special status.""

""We want to see the UK government really step up now,"" she said.

Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK should bring together a coalition of countries to avoid a tragedy in the territory.

He told the BBC: ""This is definitely the most dangerous period there has ever been in terms of that agreement.

""With our unique legal situation, Britain does have a responsibility now to pull together that international coalition and to do what we can to protect the people of Hong Kong.""

On Thursday Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""We are deeply concerned about China's legislation related to national security in Hong Kong.

""We have been very clear that the security legislation risks undermining the principle of one country, two systems.

""We are in close contact with our international partners on this and the Foreign Secretary spoke to US Secretary [Mike] Pompeo last night.""

He added: ""The steps taken by the Chinese government place the Joint Declaration under direct threat and do undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.""

On Wednesday, Mr Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it could no longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China.

130,Myka Stauffer: Backlash after YouTubers give up adopted son,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52839792,[],"Image copyright StaufferLife Image caption Myka and James Stauffer produced films about their family life on YouTube and Instagram

A couple who documented on a popular YouTube channel their life with an autistic toddler adopted from China are facing a backlash after they revealed he had been placed with another family.

Myka Stauffer and her husband James, based in Ohio, produced videos about Huxley's adoption and his challenges.

Since 2017 the couple received sponsorship deals and video revenue.

While some understood the decision, critics accused the pair of exploiting Huxley to build their YouTube career.

The news that Huxley is living permanently with another family was revealed on Tuesday after followers noticed he had not been seen in a video for some time.

The couple said unspecified behavioural issues from Huxley had made life too difficult for the family, which includes four other children.

Content on the couple's YouTube account The Stauffer Life has now been deleted.

""Extremely depressed reading about the influencer who raised funds to adopt a son, made this her 'brand,' discovered he has special needs, secretly rehomed him,"" wrote journalist Sophie Ross on Twitter.

Adopted children ""aren't a dog you adopted from the pound that you get to return in 14 days if they aren't a good fit... gross"", commented another Twitter user, one of thousands to post negative reaction.

Popular videos

The couple began sharing videos about their family life in 2014 and Mrs Stauffer's own YouTube channel Myka Stauffer grew to more than 700,000 subscribers this year.

In July 2016 they announced plans to adopt a toddler from China, and that they were considering adopting a second from ""Uganda or Ethiopia"".

The adoption agency told them Huxley had ""brain damage"", Mrs Stauffer wrote in a magazine article. After hesitating, the couple decided to proceed when ""God softened our hearts"", she wrote.

They said revenue from sponsored videos would pay for the adoption. They also asked followers to donate $5 towards supporting their son's needs, promising to write donors' names in a baby book.

One video of the family going to China to meet two-year-old Huxley was extremely popular and clocked up more than 5.5 million views on YouTube.

Tapping into the popular trend of family life videos, the couple produced hours of content documenting their son and his life following adoption.

Detailed updates on Huxley's developmental progress were included, as well as clips of him.

Other videos on the couple's YouTube and Instagram accounts included advice about pregnancy (the couple had two more children after adopting Huxley), home-schooling, decoration and household chores.

Mrs Stauffer was also interviewed in magazines about caring for children with disabilities.

Companies including Glossier and Good American offered sponsorship deals, and the birth of their fifth child was featured in People magazine in 2019.

Huxley out of sight

In September 2019, Mrs Stauffer posted an update in which she said that Huxley had received treatment following a diagnosis of autism.

But followers noticed that in late 2019 and early 2020, Huxley stopped appearing in the videos.

On Tuesday, the couple posted an update in which they explained Huxley had been given permanently to another family for the sake of his ""emotional well-being"".

The adoption agency had not given them the full picture about Huxley's health, they said, and doctors in the US said he now needed ""a different fit in his medical needs"".

""I can't explain the amount of effort Myka has put into helping Huxley,"" Mr Stauffer added.

Some who have followed the story for a while commented with messages of support. ""I respect you so much for having the courage to make such a heartbreaking and hard decision,"" one wrote.

But others accused the couple of ""getting rid"" of Huxley after making money from his experiences.

Others expressed sympathy for him. ""Although I am sure this is hard for all involved, it does not even compare to the loss this child has endured,"" one wrote.

The incident has again raised the issue of international adoptions whereby parents give up care of the children after a period of time, several people commented.","Myka Stauffer and her husband James, based in Ohio, produced videos about Huxley's adoption and his challenges.

131,Moscow more than doubles city's Covid-19 death toll,https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-52843976,[],"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Moscow has been the epicentre of the epidemic in Russia for many weeks

Moscow's authorities have more than doubled the official death toll from Covid-19 in the Russian capital for the month of April.

The city's health department now says 1,561 people died from the disease - not 639 as initially announced.

The department stressed that the new tally included even the most ""controversial, debatable"" cases.

Moscow-based reporters had said the official numbers were too low, but were accused of fake news and distortion.

Confirmation that the numbers had been under-reported emerged before Russia announced 232 new deaths, its biggest daily death toll during the pandemic so far.

With 8,572 new recorded infections, Russia has the third highest number in the world of 387,623 cases. The official number of deaths stands at 4,374.

The government says the country's mass testing programme is responsible for that low mortality rate - but many believe the numbers are in fact far higher.

Although the number of new daily infections is down from a peak of over 11,000 earlier this month, health officials in Russia's second biggest city, St Petersburg, say hospitals there are running at peak capacity.

Why was Moscow's Covid-19 death toll revised?

Moscow's health department said the death toll was revised following post-mortem examinations.

They had confirmed coronavirus as the cause of death in 169 cases where tests had initially been negative.

In addition, 756 people who died of other causes in April had tested positive for coronavirus. The officials said in many cases here the virus was a significant factor, playing the role of a ""catalyst"".

This new methodology is likely to mean the death toll will increase across the country, although Moscow was the epicentre of the epidemic for many weeks, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports.

The Moscow health department stressed that even the new count put the Covid-19 mortality rate for the city at under 3% - suggesting that was well below comparable cities, our correspondent says.

But the authorities also conceded that the figures for May would be higher.

In a separate development on Thursday, a group of well-known Russian journalists were arrested in Moscow as they took part in single-person protests over a 15-day jail term handed down to a colleague.

The journalists accused police of using the Covid-19 outbreak to crack down on activists. Most have since been released, but charged with various offences.","The city's health department now says 1,561 people died from the disease - not 639 as initially announced.

132,Coronavirus: How Turkey took control of Covid-19 emergency,https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-52831017,"['Orla Guerin', 'Bbc International Correspondent']","Image copyright EPA Image caption Turkey has a lower recorded death toll than many other countries in Europe

Covid-19 came late to Turkey - on 11 March - but soon singed every corner of the country. Within a month all 81 provinces had been affected.

It was the one of the fastest growing outbreaks in the world - worse than China or the UK. There were fears that the death toll would soar turning Turkey into another Italy, which was then the hardest hit country.

Three months on that hasn't happened, even without a total lockdown.

The official death toll is 4,397. Some doctors here dispute that, claiming the real figure could be twice as high because Turkey only includes those who test positive. Either way, in the horrific annals of the Covid-19 era, it's a relatively low number for a population of 83 million.

An unusual lockdown

Experts warn it is hard to reach conclusions and compare statistics while countries are still burying their dead. But Turkey has ""clearly averted a much bigger disaster"", according to Dr Jeremy Rossman, Lecturer in Virology at the University of Kent.

""Turkey fits in the category of several countries that responded fairly quickly with testing, tracing, isolation and movement restrictions,"" he told the BBC. ""It's a fairly small club of countries that have been quite effective in reducing the viral spread.""

As the virus multiplied, the authorities subtracted key pieces from the jigsaw of daily life - no trips to the coffee shop, no shopping in crowded markets, no communal prayers at the mosque.

The over-65s and under-20s were locked down completely, weekend curfews were imposed, and major cities were sealed off.

Istanbul was the centre of the epidemic. The city lost its rhythm, like a heart that keeps missing a beat.

How Turkey tracks the virus

Now restrictions are gradually easing, but Dr Melek Nur Aslan remains on alert. She's director of public health for the district of Fatih, a heavily populated area in the heart of old Istanbul. Dr Aslan, who is articulate, and energetic, leads a contract-tracing operation. Across Turkey there are 6,000 teams.

Image caption Dr Melek Nur Aslan says Turkey was able to start testing for the virus at the start of its outbreak

""We feel we are in a war,"" she tells me. ""People forget to go home. We say 'OK eight hours is completed' but they don't even care about going home because they know this is a duty they have to complete, before it spreads to anyone else.""

Dr Aslan says they began tracking the virus on day one - 11 March - thanks to decades of experience tracking measles. ""Those plans were ready,"" she says. ""We just got them off the shelf and started using them.""

We join two young doctors in the narrow streets of Fatih, equipped with an app, and clad in Hazmat suits. They head for an apartment block where two flatmates in their twenties have been in quarantine. Their friend is Covid-19 positive.

The women are framed in the doorway of their apartment, both in face masks, and one wearing a headscarf. They are tested on the spot for Covid-19 and will get the results within 24 hours. It's just a day since they started showing mild symptoms. Nazli Demiralp, 29, is grateful for the prompt response.

Image caption The women will get their results in 24 hours

""We follow foreign news,"" she says, ""and when we first heard about the virus we were really scared. But Turkey has rallied faster than we thought - much faster than Europe and the United States. ""

Turkey embraces hydroxychloroquine

The country has public health lessons to offer, according to acting head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Turkey, Dr Irshad Shaikh.

""Initially we were worried,"" he told the BBC. ""They were having 3,500 positive cases per day. But what has worked is testing. And they did not have to wait five or six days for results."" He also credits the quarantine, isolation and contract tracing measures but says it's too soon to judge Turkey's treatment protocol for patients.

Controversially that includes the anti-malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, as standard. It's much touted by President Donald Trump - but has been roundly rejected by the latest international research.

The WHO has temporarily suspended it from their trial of possible treatments for the virus. That followed research published in the Lancet which suggested hydroxychloroquine can cause cardiac problems in Covid-19 patients, and could do more harm than good.

We were given access to a hospital where it has been part of the standard treatment for thousands of patients. The Dr Sehit Ilhan Varank hospital, a two-year old-state hospital, is also state of the art. It's a bright, spacious battlefront against the virus.

Image caption Turkey has been using the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients

Chief doctor Nurettin Yiyit - whose art work is on the hospital walls - says it's key to use hydroxychloroquine early. ""Other countries are using this drug too late,"" he says, ""especially the United States. We only use it at the beginning. We have no hesitation about this drug. We believe it's effective because we get the results.""

On a tour of the hospital, adding and subtracting protective layers as we go, he explains that Turkey's approach is to ""get ahead of the virus"", by treating early and treating aggressively. They use hydroxychloroquine and other drugs, along with blood plasma and oxygen in high concentrations.

Dr Yiyit is proud of his hospital's mortality rate of under 1%, and of the empty beds in the intensive care unit. They try to keep patients out of here, and off ventilators.

We meet 40-year old Hakim Sukuk who has left the ICU and is homeward bound, brimming with gratitude.

Image caption Hakim Sukuk is heading home after treatment

""Everyone took care of me so well,"" he said, sitting up in bed. ""It was like being in my mother's arms.""

Not over yet

The government's handling of the pandemic has not been given a clean bill of health by the Turkish Medical Association. It says there were many mistakes in Ankara's ""inadequate"" response to the pandemic, including leaving borders open for too long.

However, Turkey is getting some credit from the WHO. ""This is a young outbreak,"" said Dr Shaikh. ""But we would expect more people to be severely sick. Something is going right.""

Turkey has advantages in the fight against Covid-19, including a young population and a high number of ICU beds. Despite this, new cases continue to be recorded, currently at the rate of about 1,000 a day.

While the country is being seen as a success story, there's still plenty of caution because the story isn't over yet.","Image copyright EPA Image caption Turkey has a lower recorded death toll than many other countries in EuropeCovid-19 came late to Turkey - on 11 March - but soon singed every corner of the country.

If convicted, Ms Chergui could face a prison sentence of up to three years.

She called on the Tunisian government to amend the law ""so they are compliant with human rights"".

In early May, when the post was first shared during the fasting month of Ramadan and while the country was still largely under lockdown, it caused a stir online.

The head of one political party condemned it without naming her, saying the state had a duty to protect what was sacred in the same way it did to prohibit apostasy and incitement to hatred - but he called for a punishment other than imprisonment.

But due to the pandemic, suppliers have not been able to grow the plants as their work was considered non-essential under government guidance, and many staff were sent home.

Councillor Jonathan Dow, Eastbourne Borough Council’s Cabinet member for climate change, said: ""These award-winning flower displays are a great source of pride for our town and year-upon-year people come to see the vibrant creations here.

""Whilst it is disappointing not to have our trademark Carpet Gardens to grace the seafront this summer, we will be using this opportunity to control a weed called Oxalis which has been prevalent in the beds for the last few years.""

The weed will be allowed to grow for a time so that it can be then be dug out with the aim of permanently eliminating it.

Councillor Dow added: ""We very much look forward to the return of our stunning Carpet Gardens displays next year for residents and visitors alike to enjoy.""","An East Sussex resort's seafront gardens are the latest casualties of the Covid-19 crisis as suppliers are unable to provide plants for floral displays this summer.

But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?”

The pricing equation

Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.”

This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.”

When will demand return?

In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100.

But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?”

The pricing equation

Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.”

191,The surprising perks of isolated work,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200527-the-surprising-perks-of-isolated-work,['Norman Miller'],"For millions of people worldwide, widespread lockdown has cast isolation as a negative – a loss of group engagement and communal hubbub. Yet while many of us are clamouring to get back into the social rhythm of the office, there are people around the world who choose work lives involving long periods isolated in remote settings.

“Some people thrive on their own company,” says Sandi Mann, senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire. “It gives the freedom of not having to worry about other people in terms of their needs or judgements. Others might like the challenge to see if they can cope on their own or to help them adjust to a different pace of life.”

Mann sees solitary times as beneficial contrasts to the pace of modern living. “We get used to high levels of dopamine from a busy, hectic and stimulation-rich environment, but dopamine is addictive. So, to wean ourselves off we need lower levels of stimulation.”

Or perhaps, rather than thinking in terms of lower levels of stimulation, those who choose to spend time out in the world in solitary are actually discovering different kinds of stimulation that crowded lives cover up.

197,Why we’ve created new language for coronavirus,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200522-why-weve-created-new-language-for-coronavirus,['Christine Ro'],"Throughout history, challenging circumstances have given rise to new ways of expressing those challenges. George Eliot, the 19th Century writer who was famously frustrated by rigid gender and lifestyle norms, is credited with the first recorded use of the word ‘frustrating’. More recently, Brexit led to a flowering of new words, including the inevitable ‘Bremain’ and ‘Bregret’, and a repurposing of existing words, such as ‘backstop’.

While Brexit may be the closest parallel, the speed of the linguistic change we’re seeing with Covid-19 is unprecedented, says Robert Lawson, a sociolinguist at Birmingham City University. Lawson attributes this to multiple factors: the dizzying pace at which the virus has spread, its dominance in the media and global interconnectivity at a time when social media and remote contact are so important.

Many of the newly popular terms relate to the socially distanced nature of human contact these days, such as ‘virtual happy hour’, ‘covideo party’ and ‘quarantine and chill’. Many use ‘corona’ as a prefix, whether Polish speakers convert ‘coronavirus’ into a verb or English speakers wonder how ‘coronababies’ (the children born or conceived during the pandemic) will fare. And, of course, there are abbreviations, like the ubiquitous ‘WFH’ and the life-saving ‘PPE’.

Like everyone else, lexicologists are scrambling to keep up with the changes the pandemic has wrought.

201,Why flats dominate Spain’s housing market,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200506-why-do-flats-dominate-spains-housing-market,['Jessica Jones'],"Own your home

Spain may be a nation of flat-dwellers, but it is also traditionally a nation of homeowners. It’s another reason why flats – that were generally cheaper to buy – became so popular. According to Eurostat figures, 76% of Spaniards owned their own home in 2018, compared to 65% of French and British people and 52% of Germans.

New rental laws and economic conditions during the 1960s meant that for the first time many Spaniards’ main goal was to own property, something encouraged by Franco, whose regime attached great importance to the home as the heart of Catholic society. “The apartment responded well to the double need to offer many housing units – in a short time and at a reduced price – and to the desire that it be owned,” says Román. “In Spain at that time, owning property became one of the main symbols of prosperity.”

New-build apartments held lavish inauguration events that included key handover ceremonies and the blessing of the new homes by a priest – acts that, says Román, were “conveniently publicised by the dictatorship’s propaganda machine”. Partly because of the government messaging, for many poor families owning a property “constituted one of life’s main aspirations”, she says.

It also made sense in a country where an inflationary economy meant most people put their money into bricks and mortar. “Financial markets were not very developed and there was a lot of inflation that would eat away at your savings. The best way to preserve their value was real estate,” adds economist Díaz Giménez.

‘Intense feeling of community’

The root of apartment living may be economic, but is there a case to be made that Spaniards just like living shoulder-to-shoulder? For many, growing up surrounded by neighbours has fostered a thriving sense of community.

Marc Pradel, 40, an expert on urban sociology at the University of Barcelona, says the dominance of apartments has “generated strong and vibrant neighbourhoods in most Spanish cities, which has reinforced local social life”. In fact, these neighbourhoods and the allure of living in the heart of the town or city is what attracts many people to live in flats.","Own your homeSpain may be a nation of flat-dwellers, but it is also traditionally a nation of homeowners.

For others – well, the transition isn’t quite as seamless. Some find all they’ve done with their eight hours is answer two emails, dream about a massage or discover their ‘cheese hour’.

It’s true: some people simply have dispositions and personality traits that enable them to better adjust to the new world of remote work than others. However, it’s not so black and white. You’re not necessarily destined to be good or bad at working remotely – some may just have to put in more effort than others.

The pull of procrastination

Procrastination is never easier than when your superior isn’t looking over your shoulder. As long as the status light on your communication app is green, it’s easy to pop into the kitchen and try a new recipe, or get into a YouTube hole, with no one any the wiser.

If it feels easier to procrastinate at home than in the office, it is for most: telework is a “weak situation” with murkier expectations about behaviour, says Timothy Pychyl, associate psychology professor at Carleton University in Ontario. In contrast, he points to a common situation: “In an elevator, we all typically ‘act elevator’, for example avoid eye contact with others, and keep our distance as [much as] possible …. The office is more of a strong situation with expectations for many things such as dress codes, arrival and departure times [and] time spent on or off task.” Weaker cues and lower accountability may make procrastination more likely at home.

And without the strong situation of an office, it’s quite a bit easier to dismiss unpleasant tasks. When there’s a task on your plate you don’t want to dive into, or you’re banging your head against a wall with a tech problem, you’re testing your ‘frustration tolerance’, says Pychyl. Those who have a lower frustration tolerance are much more likely to procrastinate – they’re the people who get up from their desk and find a distraction.","For some, working from home is a gift – a remarkable opportunity to focus and be hyper-productive, all the while finding time to walk the dog and even exercise in pyjamas.

For example, those who are prone to anxiety might read an article to source factual information about the economy, then “go down a rabbit hole” and focus on the worst-case scenario for their own income prospects. “They're saying, ‘well, you know, my job is at risk, I'm going to lose my job and then I can't support myself and then I will lose my house’,” explains Davies.

Others with anxiety may be more susceptible to feeling the pain felt by those who’ve lost lives or loved ones in the crisis. “Our imagination and memory leaves us afterwards rehearsing things in our heads... We imagine what scenes are like for people, how terrible that might be, and those types of things are distressing for people.”

Switching off the news might, however, not be so easy for this group, because “the thing about anxiety for people generally is that it pushes us to check [the information], to try and relieve anxiety”.

For those with depression, the opposite may be true. Davies says some people “switch off and become apathetic” after being exposed to too much coronavirus information, and instead turn to alternative and potentially dangerous sources of stimulation, such as too much alcohol or food.

When you can’t switch off

There’s also a sizable minority who are finding themselves consumed by the news cycle more than usual for professional reasons. Journalists, communications professionals, government officials, doctors, scientists and, most recently, disinfectant manufacturers are among those having to stay on top of daily comments, trends and data in a way they’ve never previously experienced. For many, this is happening while they are working from home and managing blurred boundaries between their work and private lives.

“I'm a journalist with a toddler, a new puppy and a tween...and I've been having a hard time sleeping because of media overload, yet I can't logically escape this as I work in journalism,” says Lorraine Allen Derosa, a freelance journalist in Spain who has been covering the pandemic for US media. This involves working late at night partly because of the time difference. “It's also the only time I can work because we have no childcare at the moment,” she admits.

Therapist John-Paul Davies says a number of his current clients (who he now sees digitally) are those who “suddenly have to be on top of the latest developments” or are spending a lot of time speaking to those who’ve been hit hardest by the coronavirus.

“Hearing those stories, you're bound to be affected by them, you know, particularly if you care about other people, and [for] a lot of journalists that’s the reason for doing it. They're interested in other people's stories.”","“Anxiety looks at the possible and focuses on that and amplifies that, rather than the probable,” explains Davies.

208,Sweden’s male-only supper clubs...for feminists,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200429-swedens-male-only-supper-clubsfor-feminists,['Maddy Savage'],"Few topics are off-limits at the male-only meetings attended by Swedish entrepreneur and environmentalist Johannes Wretljung Persson. The impact of porn, groping in clubs and misogynist banter at work have already been widely debated.

The 33-year-old says the goal is to create an environment in which a handful of men can “talk about inequality and patriarchy, and how to be a better human being”.

“It’s things people have done in the past, that they realise, ‘This is so bad that I did this!’,” adds Tård Wennerborg, a tech worker who is another attendee and organiser of the events, which take place in Västerås, west of Stockholm. “Also things you haven't done – you have heard other people say things or do things, and you haven’t reacted or opposed it.”

Across Sweden, thousands of men have participated in these single-gender get-togethers in recent years, according to non-profit organisations Make Equal and MÄN, which work to promote equality. Events have ranged from candle-lit dinner parties to debates over take-away tacos or simple coffee evenings after work in empty offices. Many follow set guidelines such as asking participants to speak for a similar amount of time on a specific gender-related topic without interruption (and with complete confidentiality). Others serve as more informal support sessions in which men focus on their own current relationships and mental health.

‘The interest was enormous’

Although Swedish feminist groups have long encouraged men to participate in discussions about gender equality and identity, all-male talk groups took off exponentially in 2016, in the wake of a string of assaults against women at Swedish music festivals. The female co-founder of Make Equal, Ida Östensson, posted on Facebook that men should consider getting their own private groups together to discuss the problem. Her call went viral within minutes.","Few topics are off-limits at the male-only meetings attended by Swedish entrepreneur and environmentalist Johannes Wretljung Persson.

211,The evolution of home fitness,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200504-covid-19-update-quarantine-home-workouts-during-coronavirus,['Bryan Lufkin'],"Most people remember their first encounter with home fitness. As a kid in the early ‘90s, I remember waking up extra early at the weekends to watch a TV programme called ‘Mousercise’, a Disney show with aerobics instructors in full Mickey and Minnie costumes teaching kids calisthenics. I was far too lazy to participate, but was fascinated by the spectacle nonetheless.

For those born slightly earlier, home fitness might be defined by memories of Jane Fonda grapevining across their TV screen in legwarmers, while for others it might be taking their inaugural steps on that weird-looking contraption known as a treadmill.

More like this:



Home fitness has been in our lives for decades – and it’s taken on a new role since the Covid-19 pandemic closed gyms around the world. Whether it’s a yoga class on Zoom or panic-buying a Peloton, many of us are trying to find ways to exercise effectively within four walls. But where did the industry of Thighmaster and Wii Fit come from – and where’s it heading after the pandemic?

At first, mostly geared toward women

Exercising has been around for a long time; yoga in India, tai chi in China and Olympic training in Greece go back thousands of years, for example. But ‘fitness’ as we know it today is a relatively new construct, not even 200 years old. One of the earliest examples comes from an illustrated guidebook written in 1861 in Victorian England, which shows women in petticoats and men in neckties exercising different muscle groups. The idea for the daily regimen came from Gustav Ernst, an orthopaedic machinist in London who invented the portable home gym, a device made of mahogany boards, cords, weights and pulleys.","Most people remember their first encounter with home fitness.

223,Spain’s mysterious mummies,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200528-the-guanches-spains-mysterious-mummies,"['Fernando Teixeira', 'Izabela Cardoso']","The Canary Islands’ subtropical climate, aquamarine waters and otherworldly volcanic and desert landscapes led more than 15 million people to visit the archipelago last year. The islands are considered the southernmost region of Spain, with their easternmost point located just 100km west of Morocco. But long before the first Spanish settlers arrived to the islands in the 1470s, another civilisation was already thriving there: the Guanches.

The Guanches’ origins have long been debated and speculated by archaeologists and historians. Some theorise they were descendants of the Celts, or perhaps the Vikings. Others believe they could even be descended from the mythical inhabitants of Atlantis. A 2019 study of the DNA from ancient mummies from the islands, however, revealed they were most likely Berbers from North Africa, who arrived there around 100AD or even earlier.

This media cannot be played on your device.

How exactly the Guanches reached the archipelago remains unclear. One theory suggests they crossed in small vessels, landing in the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. And although the number of settlers also remains a mystery, studies estimate that 14 couples would have been enough to populate the archipelago.

Archaeological studies suggest the Guanches were organised in a tribal society, where chieftains or kings ruled almost absolutely. They relied on farming, hunting and gathering, and their diet included milk, goat, pork and fruits. They mainly dressed in goat-skin leather tunics and vests made of plaited rushes and lived in caves or simple low-stone houses.

They adapted caves and grottoes to be used as silos and temples. Some of those structures have been preserved to this day and indicate the Guanches’ sophisticated astronomical knowledge: holes on the caves’ walls allowed sunlight in at certain positions during different times of the year, marking solstices and equinoxes.

One of the most noteworthy of those structures is Risco Caído, a settlement that consists of 21 caves excavated on a volcanic tuff about 100m high above the Barraco Hondo River in the island of Gran Canaria. The site is believed to have been used as a silo, a temple and a place for astronomical observation, with holes that allowed sunlight and moonlight to enter the caves and illuminate symbolic drawings on the walls. In 2019, Risco Caído became the first Unesco World Heritage site in the Canary Islands.

229,The tree that changed the world map,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200527-the-tree-that-changed-the-world-map,['Vittoria Traverso'],"Unfurling in a carpet of green where the Andes and Amazon basin meet in south-western Peru, Manú National Park is one of the most biodiverse corners of the planet: a lush, 1.5-million hectare Unesco-inscribed nature reserve wrapped in mist, covered in a chaos of vines and largely untouched by humans.

Where to see the rare cinchona tree Manú National Park, Peru: A haven of biodiversity, the Unesco nature preserve is home to an estimated 5,000 plant species. Podocarpus National Park, Ecuador: One of the last places to spot Ecuador’s national tree. Hiking through its misty trails, you may also encounter the spectacled bear, one of the Andes’ most emblematic animals. Cutervo National Park, Peru: Peru’s oldest protected area is famous for its pre-Columbian archaeological remains, 88 species of orchids and for being the last remaining cloud forest in the Peruvian highlands. Semilla Bendita Botanical Garden, Peru: This botanical garden operated by local environmentalists is home to more than 1,300 native species – including orchids and cinchonas.

But if you hack your way through the rainforest’s dense jungle, cross its rushing rivers and avoid the jaguars and pumas, you may see one of the few remaining specimens of the endangered cinchona officinalis tree. To the untrained eye, the thin, 15m-tall tree may blend into the thicketed maze. But the flowering plant, which is native to the Andean foothills, has inspired many myths and shaped human history for centuries.

“This may not be a well-known tree,” said Nataly Canales, who grew up in the Peruvian Amazonian region of Madre de Dios. “Yet, a compound extracted from this plant has saved millions of lives in human history.”

Today, Canales is a biologist at the National Museum of Denmark who is tracing the genetic history of cinchona. As she explained, it was the bark of this rare tree that gave the world quinine, the world’s first anti-malarial drug. And while the discovery of quinine was welcomed by the world with both excitement and suspicion hundreds of years ago, in recent weeks, this tree’s medical derivatives have been at the centre of another heated global debate. Synthetic versions of quinine – such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – have been touted and largely disputed as possible treatments for the novel coronavirus.

For centuries, malaria, a disease caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, has plagued people across the world. It ravaged the Roman Empire; it killed between 150 to 300 million people in the 20th Century; and, according to the World Health Organization, nearly half of the world’s population still lives in areas where the disease is transmitted.

Medieval remedies to cure “mal aria” (“bad air” in Italian) reflected the erroneous belief that it was an airborne disease and ranged from bloodletting to limb amputations to cutting a hole in the skull. But in the 17th Century, the first known cure for it was allegedly found here, deep in the Andes.

According to legend, quinine was discovered as a malaria cure in 1631 when the Countess of Cinchona, a Spanish noblewoman married to the viceroy of Peru, fell ill with a high fever and severe chills – the classic symptoms of malaria. Desperate to heal her, the viceroy gave his wife a concoction prepared by Jesuit priests made with the bark of an Andean tree and mixed with clove and rose-leaf syrups and other dried plants. The countess soon recovered and the miraculous plant that cured her was named “cinchona” in her honour. Today, it’s the national tree of Peru and Ecuador.

People across Europe began writing about a 'miraculous' malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World

Most historians now dispute this tale, but as with many legends, parts of it are true. Quinine, an alkaloid compound found in cinchona’s bark, can indeed kill the parasite that causes malaria. But it wasn’t discovered by Spanish Jesuits.

“Quinine was already known to the Quechua, the Cañari and the Chimú indigenous peoples that inhabited modern-day Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador before the arrival of the Spanish,” said Canales. “They were the ones that introduced the bark to Spanish Jesuits.” The Jesuits crushed the cinnamon-coloured bark into a thick, bitter powder that could be easily digested. The concoction came to be known as “Jesuits Powder”, and soon, people across Europe began writing about a “miraculous” malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World. By the 1640s, Jesuits had established trade routes to transport cinchona bark throughout Europe.

In France, quinine was used to cure intermittent fevers of France’s King Louis XIV at the court of Versailles. In Rome, the powder was tested by the Pope’s private physician and distributed for free by the Jesuit priests to the public. But in Protestant England, the drug was met with some scepticism, as some doctors labelled the Catholic-promoted concoction a “papal poison”. Oliver Cromwell allegedly died of malarial complications after refusing “Jesuit Powder”. Nevertheless, by 1677, cinchona bark was first listed by the Royal College of Physicians in its London Pharmacopoeia as an official medicine used by English physicians to treat patients.

To fuel their cinchona craze, Europeans hired locals to find the precious “fever tree” in the rainforest, scrape its bark with a machete and take it to cargo ships awaiting in Peruvian ports. Increased demand for cinchona quickly led the Spanish to declare the Andes “the pharmacy of the world”, and as Canales explained, the cinchona tree soon become scarce.

Cinchona’s value soared during the 19th Century, when malaria was one of the greatest threats faced by European troops deployed in overseas colonies. According to Dr Rohan Deb Roy, author of Malarial Subjects, obtaining adequate supplies of quinine became a strategic advantage in the race for global domination, and cinchona bark turned into one of the world’s hottest commodities.

Quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major 'tools of imperialism' that powered the British Empire

“European soldiers engaged in colonial wars frequently died of malaria,” said Deb Roy. “Drugs like quinine enabled soldiers to survive in tropical colonies and win wars.”

As he explains, cinchona was especially used by the Dutch in Indonesia; by the French in Algeria; and most famously, by the British in India, Jamaica and across South-East Asia and West Africa. In fact, between 1848 and 1861, the British government spent the equivalent of £6.4m each year importing cinchona bark to store for its colonial troops. As a result, quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major “tools of imperialism” that powered the British Empire.

“Much like countries today are rushing to get to a Covid-19 vaccine to get a competitive advantage, countries back then rushed to get quinine” explained Patricia Schlagenhauf, a professor of travel medicine at the University of Zurich specialising in malaria.

Churchill allegedly said the drink had saved 'more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire'

It wasn’t just cinchona bark that was valuable. Its seeds become a high-demand commodity too. “British and Dutch governments wanted to plant cinchona in their own colonies to stop their dependence on South America,” Deb Roy explained. But choosing the right seed wasn’t easy. Each of the 23 species of cinchona has a different quinine content. It was thanks to locals with indigenous botanical knowledge that Europeans could secure quinine-rich species to export abroad.

By the mid-1850s, the British had successfully established “fever tree” plantations in southern India, where malaria was rampant. Soon, British authorities started distributing locally harvested quinine to soldiers and civil servants. It’s long been rumoured that they allegedly mixed gin with their quinine to make it more palatable, thus inventing the first tonic water and the famous gin and tonic drink. Today, small amounts of quinine are still found in tonic water. But as Kim Walker, who co-authored the book Just the Tonic points out, this British origin story is likely a myth. “It seems like they added whatever was handy” – be it rum, brandy or arrack, she explained.

Plus, as Schlagenhauf adds, quinine has a short lifespan in the body so sipping on a gin and tonic at cocktail hour would not be enough to guarantee protection against malaria. Nevertheless, the myth of gin and tonic as a potent anti-malaria prevention tricked even Winston Churchill, who allegedly said the drink had saved “more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire.”

Of course, the gin and tonic is just one drink tied to the “fever tree”. Today, the most famous cocktail in Peru may be the American-invented pisco sour, but the most popular among Peruvians is arguably the bitter, quinine-flavoured pisco tonic, a homegrown invention that’s often mixed with maiz morado (purple corn) from the Andes to make a pisco morada tonic. If you’ve ever sipped liqueurs like Campari, Pimm’s or the French aperitif Lillet (a key ingredient in James Bond’s famous Vesper martini), you’ve tasted quinine. It’s also found in Scotland’s “other” national drink, Irn-Bru, and in what is reported to be Queen Elizabeth II’s favourite drink, gin and Dubonnet – an aperitif which, coincidentally, was invented by a French chemist to make quinine more palatable for French troops stationed in North African colonies.

Quinine was eventually pushed aside in the 1970s by artemisinin, a drug derived from the sweet wormwood plant, as the world’s go-to malaria remedy. Still, the legacy of quinine runs deep around the world. Today, Ban-dung, Indonesia, is known as “The Paris of Java” because the Dutch transformed this once-sleepy port into the world’s largest quinine centre, brimming with Art Deco buildings, ballrooms and hotels. English is widely spoken in places as diverse as India, Hong Kong, Sierra Leone, Kenya and coastal Sri Lanka; and French in Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria today partly because of quinine. And in Spanish, there is still an expression that states, “ser más malo que la quina” – which roughly translates as, “to be worse than quinine”, a reference to the bark’s bitter taste.

At the height of the global “quinine hunt” in the 1850s, Peru and Bolivia both established monopolies over their highly lucrative tree bark exports. In fact, much of La Paz’s Neoclassical cathedral and many of the cobblestone streets running through the city’s plaza-filled historic centre today were built with cinchona bark, which at one point accounted for 15% of Bolivia’s total tax revenue.

However, the centuries-long demand for cinchona bark has left a visible scar on its native habitat. In 1805, explorers documented 25,000 cinchona trees in the Ecuadorean Andes. The same area, now part of the Podocarpus National Park, counts just 29 trees.

It is to plants that we owe some of the major medicinal breakthroughs in human history

Canales explained that the removal of quinine-rich species from the Andes has changed the genetic structure of cinchona plants, reducing their ability to evolve and change. Part of Canales’ work, in collaboration with the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew outside London, is to look at old cinchona bark specimens preserved in museums to study how human behaviour may have altered the plant. “We think that cinchona may have evolved to contain less quinine because of overharvesting,” she explained.

Recently, the World Health Organization halted studies of quinine’s synthetic descendant, hydroxychloroquine, as a possible coronavirus treatment amid safety concerns. Despite the fact that the drug is now developed in labs versus extracted from forests, Canales says the protection of the cinchona and the endangered “pharmacy of the world” that nurtures it, is crucial for the discovery of new drugs in the future.

In the absence of government protection of cinchona, local conservation groups are stepping in. Environmental organisation Semilla Bendita, literally “blessed seeds”, is planning to plant 2021 cinchona seeds for the 200th anniversary of Peru’s independence in 2021, and scientists like Schlagenhauf hope that more efforts to preserve the Andes’ biodiversity will follow.

“What the story of quinine shows is that biodiversity and human health go hand in hand,” Schlagenhauf said. “People often think of plant-based remedies as ‘alternative medicine’, but it is to plants that we owe some of the major medicinal breakthroughs in human history.

237,Sweden’s single-diner restaurant,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200526-swedens-single-diner-restaurant,['Lola Akinmade Åkerström'],"The romantic picture of sitting in a lush meadow surrounded by blooming wildflowers and dining from a picnic basket might conjure up thoughts of Instagram lifestyle influencers, who tend to be mostly female. But for Linda Karlsson, her novel dining idea’s main demographic has surprised her.

“Men,” she said. “It has been almost only men who have booked the table.”

“The table” she refers to is, in fact, her new restaurant Bord För En (Table For One), which opened on 10 May. Located in Ransäter, a tiny rural town tucked in the Swedish countryside in Värmland, around 350km west of Stockholm, it consists of a sole wooden table and single chair set in her garden overlooking a verdant pasture. A candle and bouquet of wildflowers finish off the demure table setting.

The food is a way of sending people to a warm and slow night in Barcelona since we’re unable to travel during these times

The story behind this new venture is as sweet as the setting. When Karlsson’s elderly parents wanted to visit her during the current Covid-19 situation, she and her partner, Rasmus Persson, needed to devise a way of sharing a meal with them without compromising their health. Since they couldn’t sit at the same table for safety reasons, they decided to set up a table outside in the garden to “remotely dine” with Karlsson’s parents while they conversed through the window.

Watching that tranquil scene as her parents dined outside lit a creative spark within both Karlsson and Persson. They realised they could invite others to enjoy this peaceful solitude while still maintaining some social distancing.

And thus, the idea of their single-diner restaurant was born.

Each evening at 19:00, their solo customer takes a seat at the table and eats alone to the sounds of rustling trees and chirping birds. There are no wait staff and no direct human contact. To deliver the food safely, a red and white gingham-frill basket is attached to a rope and served from Karlsson’s second-floor kitchen window via a pulley system fashioned using an old bicycle wheel to their guest sitting 50m away.

You may also be interested in:

• America's 'fried chicken war'

• The Swedish word poached by the world

• The dish that ended the plague

This setup not only allows them to adhere to the current recommendations from the Public Health Agency of Sweden to maintain 1-2m of space between people, but allows diners complete solitude and tranquillity.

Once the guest opens the basket, they’ll find the first of their three courses. To notify the kitchen that they are ready for their next course, they simply need to ring the bell attached to the pulley system. The menu is always the same; changes are only made if Karlsson and Persson can’t get hold of the locally produced goods they’re committed to using as part of their food philosophy.

While Karlsson’s background is in hospitality and communications, their plant-based, vegetarian-friendly three-course offering is crafted by Persson, who trained as a chef in Gothenburg, worked at high-end seafood restaurant Sjömagasinet and learned from legendary Swedish chef Leif Mannerström. Persson’s gastronomic stints also took him to Barcelona, and his cuisine is infused with Spanish-inspired elements.

The first course is råraka, Swedish-style hash browns with thick smetana sour cream, seaweed caviar and sorrel. It’s followed by “Black & Yellow”, a plating of yellow carrot-ginger puree, browned hazelnut butter, sweetcorn croquette (redolent of Spanish tapas) and serpent root (Spanish salsify) ash.

“The food is a way of sending people to a warm and slow night in Barcelona since we’re unable to travel during these times,” Karlsson said.

The dessert, called “Last Days of Summer”, is ginned blueberries with iced buttermilk and viola sugar made from their homegrown beetroots. It’s a secret recipe handed down from Persson’s grandmother, who recently passed away at 99 years old.

“Rasmus knows how to make these dishes at home, so I'm very pleased,” Karlsson said. “And since I can't cook at all, that's one reason why I married a chef.”

Drink pairings are made from non-alcoholic spirit Seedlip with seasonal ingredients such as elderflower and strawberries, and are curated by renowned bar owner Joel Söderbäck, who grew up in Ransäter and whose Stockholm-based cocktail bar Tjoget was awarded a spot on the World's 50 Best Bars in 2019.

Due to current travel restrictions worldwide, most of Bord För En's patrons so far have been locals from Ransäter and the region of Värmland, and the waitlist can range from a few people to more than a dozen depending on the day of the week. While many people have tried to make a two-person reservation, suggesting that their dining partners can sit on the grass to enforce social distancing, Karlsson notes that this defeats the purpose of the solo experience.

“It’s really about having the time to get to know yourself and to truly honour that,” Karlsson said.

She believes there’s more to her concept than just novelty. What was a call of duty to help enforce social distancing guidelines has unwittingly turned into a quiet, self-care movement. With much of the world in lockdown or quarantine, Karlsson believes people are realising they’re afraid of spending time alone, and she wants to help turn the experience into a positive one.

“Our business model is not a very lucrative one,” says Karlsson. “We only accept one guest per day just to be able to really have the opportunity to make our guests create their own space.”

It’s really about having the time to get to know yourself and to truly honour that

For Karlsson, it’s hard to put a time limit on creating that personal introspective space. It often makes her think of American poet Mary Oliver’s poem “The Summer Day” and the question it poses: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” That’s why, beyond supplying the food and the venue, she leaves the exact experience up to the guest, who is free to linger for hours over their meal, read, write, soak up nature, and fully exist in the moment without distractions. There’s no closing time or harried waiter bringing the bill.

In fact, there’s no bill at all. In lieu of payment, guests are invited to make a voluntary contribution based on what they feel the meal and experience was worth to them. Karlsson and Persson were never planning to turn profits from serving a single meal a day, and are instead donating proceeds to Ulla-Britt Henrikssons Kulturstipendium, a fund to support creative mothers set up by Persson. Named after his mother Ulla-Britt and inspired by her setting aside her own creative dreams to raise him and his siblings, the fund awards 10,000 kr (£845) on Mother’s Day, 26 May, to support a nominated mother towards realising her own artistic vision.

As for why their clientele has been mostly male? Karlsson has no idea. “I don't have the answer as to why it's been mostly men,” she said. “But our table is available to everyone.” She notes that women don’t often treat themselves out to solo dinners and maybe it’s time to consider this as one more necessary act of self-care.

Karlsson and Persson plan to keep Bord För En open until 1 August and reopen annually every spring and summer. And with lots of international interest from fellow chefs and foodie colleagues, Persson and Karlsson are now considering expanding their idea globally. They are currently inviting chefs who are interested in launching similar concepts to apply.

“Our vision is to open up more tables around the world and unite our feeling of being alone together,” said Karlsson.

241,How to make pizza like a Neapolitan master,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200415-how-to-make-pizza-like-a-neapolitan-master,['Ondine Cohane'],"When you think of Italy’s most memorable dishes, its beloved pizza will most likely be among your top five, if not top three, favourites. It’s an ultimate comfort food that has become an ever-growing obsession around the world. But what is it that makes pizza from Italy so special, and where do you find the very best?

The most important thing was to see the humanity and connection there needs to be in a pizzeria

Like so many of the country’s most prized gastronomic delights like wine, olive oil and cheese, the quintessential pie from Naples, where pizza was born, has become so cherished that it’s now worthy of its own Designation of Controlled Origin (DOC). The city’s pizza-making tradition even received Unesco recognition in 2017 as an intangible cultural heritage item.

Naples is, of course, the hub of the pizza napoletana (Neapolitan pizza), with generations of the same family groomed in the art of being a pizzaiolo (pizzamaker). And each family carefully guards its recipe variations and bakes pizza with a passion that’s matched perhaps only by the city’s love for its football team.

There are three basic types of Neapolitan pizza: the Margherita, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil; the marinara, which skips the cheese and uses oregano and garlic instead of basil; and the “DOC” made with mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella) instead of the usual fior di latte made from cow’s milk.

Pizza is said to have originated in the city in the 1700s, after explorers brought one of the essential ingredients, the tomato, from Peru. But even before that, Neapolitans had been eating a version of the pita brought from Arabic immigrants as a kind of flatbread – which eventually became “pizza” in the local dialect. Most upper-class Europeans viewed the new tomato import with suspicion and originally considered it to be poisonous; at no fault of the tomato, people would place the acidic fruits on pewter plates, from which they’d leach lead, causing illness. But in a time of almost famine, local Neapolitans started topping their humble but delicious flatbreads with tomatoes, and soon the creation became a staple of the city’s cuisine.

Following the 1861 unification of the country, baker Raffaele Esposito was credited, in 1889, with inventing the now ubiquitous Margherita pizza in honour of the visit of Queen Margherita di Savoia, the wife of King Umberto the I, to the city. The colours of the Italian flag were mirrored in the ingredients: tomatoes for red; cheese for white; and basil for green. And thus, the iconic pizza was born.

Today, there are more than 500 pizzerias in Naples, but only a fifth of them are certified by the True Neapolitan Pizza Association, an organisation that was created in 1984 to protect and distinguish the authentic pies from the wannabees. Its criteria is based not only on the ingredients that go into the pie – including everything from the type of flour in the dough to the provenance of the cheese – but also the preparation, from the dough fermentation style to oven temperature. The association now even holds an annual contest to judge which pizza makers are the best in the world. Franco Pepe from Pepe in Grani has won the last three years in a row.

Pizza makers like Pepe have achieved a kind of rock-star status in Italy nowadays, but the work is quite physically exhausting, with a great attention given to seemingly simple methods.

Among the most famous pizzaioli in town, Gino Sorbillo is a third-generation dough wizard who runs Gino e Toto Sorbillo pizzeria, which is often considered one of Naples’ best. His father was one of 21 children (number 19), all of whom helped with the family’s pizza-making business. It was the same for Sorbillo’s generation: “[The whole family] assisted in every step from buying the materials, [making] the dough and seeing how to treat the ingredients,” he explained. “But the most important thing was to see the humanity and connection there needs to be in a pizzeria,” as the pizza-making process requires manual labour, long hours, and, for the Sorbillo family, working in a humble and sometimes difficult part of town.

His grandfather opened the family’s first pizza parlour back in 1935 along Via dei Tribunali, a historically troubled street in the centre of Naples that’s been rife with organised crime. That background has always been on Sorbillo’s mind, who wants to promote the city he loves and provide a refuge from gang activity for his patrons and workers. His Naples location was bombed last year, but ever determined, he has since reopened.

Sorbillo now has pizzerias in places like Tokyo and New York, and although he monitors each one for its adherence to the family’s recipes, it’s this first location in Via dei Tribunali that remains the business’ centrepiece, where locals and tourists alike line up to taste the original pizza. The pizzeria has also helped breathe life into the city, which has a reputation for being the country’s most chaotic and among its poorest. “I think I also gave some younger people the inspiration that we could do something here in Naples, to say, ‘we are going to try to so something too’,” he said.

It’s [how you make] the dough that’s essential

So, how does one make an authentic Neapolitan pizza, especially for those who can’t go to Naples to eat one?

To begin with, the dough has to be just right, with the use of Italian 00 or 0 wheat flour, fresh brewer’s yeast (no dry yeast), water and salt. The dough must be rolled by hand or with a slow speed mixer; never using a rolling pin. However, twirling it in the air to oxygenate the dough while belting out a Neapolitan classic might be best left to the professional pizzaioli.

Ciro Salvo of 50 Kalò, another of the city’s most esteemed masters, has another dough-making must: “The fermentation and leavening of the dough must be at least 10 to 12 hours.”

Raw, pureed tomatoes are another necessary ingredient for a great pie – preferably San Marzano, Italy’s most prized variety, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius and are required for pizzas with DOC designation. However, pizza star Franco Pepe prefers to use his own home-grown heirloom tomatoes.

Only two types of mozzarella are used for Neapolitan pizza: fior di latte made from cow’s milk; or mozzarella di bufala, made from the milk of the water buffalo that live in the country’s Campania and Lazio regions. These days, at some farms, the gentle beasts receive massages and listen to classic music as part of their routine to produce the tastiest milk around.

Of course, part of Neapolitan pizza’s fame comes from how it’s cooked. The dough must be no more than 3mm thick, and must bake for 60 to 90 seconds at a very high temperature – 485°C – inside a wood-burning oven, resulting in a pizza that’s crispy but not burnt. It all sounds easy enough, but there is a reason why some pizzamakers are considered true masters: that moment just before a pie becomes a burned mistake often lies in an expert’s eye.

But even if you don’t have DOC-qualified ingredients or a wood-burning oven, according to Sorbillo, all you really need to make a good pie is flour, yeast, a can of tomatoes and cheese that’s made from cow’s milk. “It’s [how you make] the dough that’s essential,” he said.

And as with any pastime, pizza-making involves a bit of trial and error. Mistakes and all, the whole process – along with getting to enjoy the final result – is all part of the fun.

A home challenge The True Neapolitan Pizza Association is holding a free contest called #VeraPizzaContest for pizza makers (amateur and professionals alike) to see who makes the best pizza designed and made at home. Entries close on 20 April.

“I am lucky,” Salvo said. “It’s not just my work but my passion and my life.” He himself eats a Margherita pizza at least once a day.

Neapolitan pizza dough recipe

By Ciro Salvo of 50 Kalò

450g flour (ideally 00, but can use 0 or 1)

300ml cold tap water

3g fresh brewer's yeast

9g salt

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the cold tap water, and then mix in about two-thirds of the flour with a big spoon until a creamy consistency is formed. Mix in the salt, and then the remaining flour a little bit at a time. Continue to mix until all the flour has been absorbed.

Knead energetically with your hands by folding the dough and pushing it inwards. When the dough is smooth and no longer has lumps, let it rest for 10-15 minutes.

Dust the dough with flour, place it on a table and then give it a few folds, forming it into a spherical shape until it’s firm and elastic.

Place dough inside an oiled baking tin and cover, and then allow it to rest and rise for 7-8 hours at room temperature.

Place dough onto a round sheet pan that’s been lightly greased with olive oil, and lightly press it with your fingertips until the classical, flat-and-round pizza shape is formed (or into a square if using a square-shaped pan). It should be no more than 3mm thick. Cover and let rest for another 3 hours.

Add tomatoes (or tomato puree) as desired onto the flattened dough, and put pizza on the base of the oven, baking at 250-280°C for 5-6 minutes. Move pizza to the top rack of the oven and bake for another 6-8 minutes, adding drained mozzarella (if using) only in the last 3-4 minutes. Other ingredients such as extra virgin olive oil and basil should be added at the end of cooking.

242,How to make pizza like a Neapolitan master,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200415-how-to-make-pizza-like-a-neapolitan-master,['Ondine Cohane'],"When you think of Italy’s most memorable dishes, its beloved pizza will most likely be among your top five, if not top three, favourites. It’s an ultimate comfort food that has become an ever-growing obsession around the world. But what is it that makes pizza from Italy so special, and where do you find the very best?

The most important thing was to see the humanity and connection there needs to be in a pizzeria

Like so many of the country’s most prized gastronomic delights like wine, olive oil and cheese, the quintessential pie from Naples, where pizza was born, has become so cherished that it’s now worthy of its own Designation of Controlled Origin (DOC). The city’s pizza-making tradition even received Unesco recognition in 2017 as an intangible cultural heritage item.

Naples is, of course, the hub of the pizza napoletana (Neapolitan pizza), with generations of the same family groomed in the art of being a pizzaiolo (pizzamaker). And each family carefully guards its recipe variations and bakes pizza with a passion that’s matched perhaps only by the city’s love for its football team.

There are three basic types of Neapolitan pizza: the Margherita, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil; the marinara, which skips the cheese and uses oregano and garlic instead of basil; and the “DOC” made with mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella) instead of the usual fior di latte made from cow’s milk.

Pizza is said to have originated in the city in the 1700s, after explorers brought one of the essential ingredients, the tomato, from Peru. But even before that, Neapolitans had been eating a version of the pita brought from Arabic immigrants as a kind of flatbread – which eventually became “pizza” in the local dialect. Most upper-class Europeans viewed the new tomato import with suspicion and originally considered it to be poisonous; at no fault of the tomato, people would place the acidic fruits on pewter plates, from which they’d leach lead, causing illness. But in a time of almost famine, local Neapolitans started topping their humble but delicious flatbreads with tomatoes, and soon the creation became a staple of the city’s cuisine.

Following the 1861 unification of the country, baker Raffaele Esposito was credited, in 1889, with inventing the now ubiquitous Margherita pizza in honour of the visit of Queen Margherita di Savoia, the wife of King Umberto the I, to the city. The colours of the Italian flag were mirrored in the ingredients: tomatoes for red; cheese for white; and basil for green. And thus, the iconic pizza was born.

Today, there are more than 500 pizzerias in Naples, but only a fifth of them are certified by the True Neapolitan Pizza Association, an organisation that was created in 1984 to protect and distinguish the authentic pies from the wannabees. Its criteria is based not only on the ingredients that go into the pie – including everything from the type of flour in the dough to the provenance of the cheese – but also the preparation, from the dough fermentation style to oven temperature. The association now even holds an annual contest to judge which pizza makers are the best in the world. Franco Pepe from Pepe in Grani has won the last three years in a row.

Pizza makers like Pepe have achieved a kind of rock-star status in Italy nowadays, but the work is quite physically exhausting, with a great attention given to seemingly simple methods.

Among the most famous pizzaioli in town, Gino Sorbillo is a third-generation dough wizard who runs Gino e Toto Sorbillo pizzeria, which is often considered one of Naples’ best. His father was one of 21 children (number 19), all of whom helped with the family’s pizza-making business. It was the same for Sorbillo’s generation: “[The whole family] assisted in every step from buying the materials, [making] the dough and seeing how to treat the ingredients,” he explained. “But the most important thing was to see the humanity and connection there needs to be in a pizzeria,” as the pizza-making process requires manual labour, long hours, and, for the Sorbillo family, working in a humble and sometimes difficult part of town.

His grandfather opened the family’s first pizza parlour back in 1935 along Via dei Tribunali, a historically troubled street in the centre of Naples that’s been rife with organised crime. That background has always been on Sorbillo’s mind, who wants to promote the city he loves and provide a refuge from gang activity for his patrons and workers. His Naples location was bombed last year, but ever determined, he has since reopened.

Sorbillo now has pizzerias in places like Tokyo and New York, and although he monitors each one for its adherence to the family’s recipes, it’s this first location in Via dei Tribunali that remains the business’ centrepiece, where locals and tourists alike line up to taste the original pizza. The pizzeria has also helped breathe life into the city, which has a reputation for being the country’s most chaotic and among its poorest. “I think I also gave some younger people the inspiration that we could do something here in Naples, to say, ‘we are going to try to so something too’,” he said.

Scientists have found that the submerged forest contains pine, alder, oak and birch tree stumps, which have all been preserved due to the lack of oxygen and high alkaline levels found in the bog. The living trees became gradually waterlogged with peat growth when the area was inundated by rising sea levels some 4,000-5,000 years ago. As the water level rose and a thick blanket of peat formed from natural sedimentation, the trees stopped growing and eventually died.

Old animal bones and a pair of deer antlers have been discovered here, too, suggesting that this stretch of land once flourished when the sea level was lower and before the area had completely succumbed to the ocean. Whether or not the forest is actually the one mentioned in the myth of Cantre’r Gwaelod, archaeologists believe there was life here dating back to at least the Bronze Age (3000 to 1200BC), in part because of the discovery of a timber walkway made of coppiced branches and upright posts (designed to cope with rising water levels) that’s thought to be between 3,100 and 4,000 years old.

Various other archaeological discoveries have been made here, including fossilised human and animal footprints preserved in the hardened top layer of peat, along with scatterings of burnt stones thought to be from ancient hearths.

The more I traverse the globe, the more I realise that the Germans are the great travellers of the modern world.

Our coverage during coronavirus While travelling is on hold due to the coronavirus outbreak, BBC Travel will continue to inform and inspire our readers who want to learn about the world as much as they want to travel there, offering stories that celebrate the people, places and cultures that make this world so wonderfully diverse and amazing. For travel information and stories specifically related to coronavirus, please read the latest updates from our colleagues at BBC News.

And they have several words that reflect their love of exploration. They gave us the word “wanderlust”, after all, which combines the German words wandern, meaning to “wander”, and lust, or “desire”. It’s a word so provocative to English speakers with a yen to see the world that we’ve borrowed it from the German and have taken it as our own.

But what if our lust for travel causes us a deep yearning pain, an ache that reminds us we have to get out and see the world? What if we’re trapped inside our homes because a virus has taken the Earth and its inhabitants hostage and we feel despair that we simply cannot travel at all?

Well, the Germans naturally have a word for that too.

Meet fernweh. Marrying the words fern, or distance, and wehe, an ache or sickness, the word can be roughly translated as “distance sickening” or “far woe” – a pain to see far-flung places beyond our doorstep. Think of it as the opposite of heimweh (homesickness). It’s an ache many of us have felt but hitherto we didn’t have a word to describe it. We do now.

Often online English language dictionaries will define fernweh simply as “wanderlust” and then explain that it means a “desire to travel”. But these bland definitions are way off the mark. Plus, there’s a big difference. Fernweh actually grew out of wanderlust, a popular word in the 19th-Century German romantic movement which valued a love of nature that stemmed from a sudden Teutonic interest in exploring Central Europe’s forests and untrammelled landscapes.

Most sources trace the word back to one Prince Hermann Ludwig Heinrich von Pückler-Muskau. A landscape gardener, Herr Pückler-Muskau also had been bitten by the travel bug and would end up publishing several books about his wanderings around Europe and North Africa (using the penname “Semilasso”). In 1835, Pückler-Muskau published The Penultimate Course of the World of Semilasso: Dream and Waking. In it, he uses the word fernweh several times, stating that he never suffers from homesickness, or heimweh, but instead suffers from the opposite affliction of fernweh.

Fernweh first appeared in English in Daniel Garrison Brinton’s 1902 book The Basis of Social Relation, in which the author described Fernweh as a deep desire or ache to travel or a “goading restlessness”. Still, though the word wanderlust was a more popular part of the German lexicon at this point. But deep into the 20th Century, German usage of wanderlust faded, replaced instead by fernweh, a word that sounds decidedly unsexy compared to the word that begat it. In the latter half of 20th Century, German travel agencies revived the word by using it in their advertisements to entice the German public to put their passports to use.

No longer were wanderlust-fuelled jaunts into the forest enough for Germans. Fernweh not only implies going beyond the borders of Germany, but journeying deep into other parts of the planet. Its more than just a lust to be on the road; it’s an actual aching or pain. Perhaps the rise of fernweh and the decline of wanderlust speaks to the emergence of the mass travel industry and the technological advancements that allowed us the ease of international travel.

Without knowing it, many of us have probably experienced fernweh. I have. One of my early memories – maybe I was three or four – was standing on a hill in my neighbourhood in Dubuque, Iowa, surveying rolling streets and houses in the distance and yearning to see what was beyond. I yearned so hard – if that’s possible – that I could feel pangs of hunger and agony in my stomach. I knew that I couldn’t go off on my own, but I made a pact with myself that when I was older, when I was big enough to bring my stuffed animal collection with me, I’d go see what was beyond the horizon. I never did get to explore, as my family moved to Los Angeles and I grew out of keeping stuffed animals. But as I got older, especially when I got a drivers’ licence, I began going down long roads just to finally see what was beyond the bend. And then I began flying and taking the bus and the train, never content to really feel settled.

“I think fernweh for Germans refers to a longing for warmer and sunnier places, palm trees, lemon trees but also a different way of life, more carefree and less ordered,” said Ilona Vandergriff, German professor at San Francisco State University (and, full disclosure, my former German professor). To really comprehend the significance of fernweh, it’s important to understand that the concept is a break from the legendarily ordered society in which Germans live. The pain or wehe was caused by a yen to escape the rigidity of the society in which they’d been raised. Vandergriff points to a passage from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s 1795 novel Wilhelm Meister’s Apprentice. In it, the character Mignon yearns to go to the “Land wo die Zitronen blühen”, or the land where the lemons bloom.

Vandergriff adds: “Goethe’s own life nicely mirrors the German travel desires: leaving the constraints of life in Germany (or in Goethe’s case, Weimar) behind and enjoying a freer life in Italy, sun, warmth, great beauty and free love.”

In an academic paper titled Home and Away: A Self-Reflexive Auto-/Ethnography scholar Christiane Alsop explains the difference between wanderlust and fernweh: “The English wanderlust expresses the longing to leave but it emphasises the tourist’s longing for a week or two of adventure. The German meaning, however, entails a horizon narrowing down on us to a point where home becomes almost suffocating and we wander off. We leave the desert of the familiar. Consequently, we meet the new environment with enthusiasm, experience the widening of our horizon as empowering and explore aspects of our identity that were buried at home.”

Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nobokov summed up the idea of fernweh quite nicely in his novel Mary, when he wrote: “Nostalgia in reverse, the longing for yet another strange land, grew especially strong in spring.”

As spring has nearly sprung in the northern hemisphere and the majority of travel-obsessed humans are planted in their homes, many of us will start feeling the aches and pains of fernweh. Which means soon enough, once we kill the coronavirus beast, there are going to be a lot of people dusting of their passport.

245,Letters from the trenches: A wartime solution to isolation,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200414-how-letter-writing-can-bring-us-together-in-tough-times,['Melissa Banigan'],"Like many young lovers separated during World War Two, my American grandparents narrated their entire romance over letters, from the beginning of their courtship in early 1944 to the Western Union telegram a year and a half later that simply read, “DARLING BE HOME BEFORE BREAKFAST LOVE GENE”.

Although the letters my grandmother wrote to her future husband were lost to time, she kept my grandfather’s letters in her possession until her death in 2005. My cousin Brooke inherited the letters and kept them tucked away in a box for nearly 10 years. In 2014, Brooke also died. Soon thereafter, her mother sent the letters to me in Brooklyn. Over a span of half a century, the letters travelled across two countries and an ocean to reach me, and they have outlived many of the people I loved best in this world. It is not hyperbole to say that they are my most precious heirloom.

I wept the first time I read the letters. During the preceding decade, I had lost a number of family members and friends to illness and accident, and I myself had flirted with death after being bedridden in an intensive care unit with pneumonia and sepsis. It was during my subsequent period of convalescence that I pored over the letters. Despite having been forced to communicate under the dark cloud of war, my grandfather filled reams of stationery with humorous wartime anecdotes and messages of hope and love. His words were just the balm I needed to soothe my ailing spirit, and seeing his beautiful handwriting brought him back to life.

Five years have passed since I first read my grandfather’s letters, and I am once again housebound. This time, just like billions of other people around the world, I am under stay-at-home orders in an effort to contain the Covid-19 virus.

Social media is a ‘double-edged sword’

During the first week of my isolation, I read the news and scrolled through my social media feeds to see how my friends and family were faring. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo warned that the virus was moving through our state “faster than a bullet train”, and some of my friends started posting about loved ones who had died or who were on ventilators. My nerves were soon worn raw by the constant onslaught of harsh realities, terrifying statistics and misinformation. I turned once again to my grandfather’s letters not only for spiritual comfort, but also in an effort to decrease my rising levels of anxiety.

“Social media is a ‘double-edged sword’,” psychotherapist Roberta Borden Wilson told me. While it allows us to stay connected to the outside world, she explained, it also forces instantaneous communication, making it impossible for us to filter out negative posts. All this negativity can trigger our brains into releasing a cascade of stress hormones that raises blood pressure, increases anxiety and depression and also contributes to substance abuse issues and addiction.

“At a time when we want to stay as healthy and strong as possible, all of this added stress can impact our immune systems, making us more susceptible to a virus,” Borden Wilson warned.

Although I was fairly certain that social media was raising my blood pressure, reading my grandfather’s letters seemed to defuse a little of my anxiety. The world melted away as I read these few lines, written mid-1945 in Joigny, France, when he was just 22 years old.

“My Dearest Darling Mary. As I lay here on my bunk, I gaze every once in a while out my window, which overlooks a broad field with a canal and river running through it. At present it looks so peaceful that one would never realize that one year ago a war was fought on this land. The grass is green and the trees in the surrounding forest are tall and strong. The evening sunset casts a glow over the pale blue sky. The little path by the canal was made for lovers, for people like you and I.”

I asked Borden Wilson if there was really something to the feelings of peacefulness and calm I experienced while reading my grandfather’s words – was the act of reading and writing letters all that different from writing social media posts?

“Absolutely,” she replied. “Writing letters engages practices that we consider within psychotherapy to be mindfulness. When we put pen to paper, we have a tendency to be more reflective and insightful and sensitive about what we write. The process makes us want to be the very best versions of ourselves. Writing letters uplifts others and we avoid the sort of negative ‘word vomit’ we see in social media.”

My grandfather was a sergeant with the US Army, a parachutist who leaped into the sky from airplanes over France’s battlefields. His friends had been deployed far and wide, scattered like seeds across the Pacific Asian and European theatres, and my grandfather didn’t know if he would ever make it home to his sweetheart. Yet his wartime letters overflowed with youthful idealism and love-sick hopes for the future:

“I love you so much that I’m really tied up. I want to make plans with you. Some day if all my dreams come true I’ll want to ask you to be my wife.”

Writing wartime letters wasn’t particular to World War Two. A couple of years ago, I visited the Verdun Memorial, a museum in north-eastern France that commemorates the horrifically bloody Battle of Verdun that took place towards the end of World War One. Situated in the bucolic countryside on what was once a battlefield, the museum is replete with displays filled with rifles, uniforms and field artillery. Yet the objects that struck me most were the personal effects soldiers had carried close to their hearts and the letters they had written to their loved ones from the trenches.

When we put pen to paper, we have a tendency to be more reflective and insightful

I spoke with Nicolas Czubak, learning resource manager at the Verdun Museum, about these remarkable letters. Regardless of their origin or social class, “all soldiers and their families were confronted with the same terrible reality of war. Yet optimism, hope for life and even humour are found in these writings,” Czubak said. Penning letters was a way for soldiers to “show that they could do something with their hands other than killing men. It helped the men,” said Czubak, “get away from the horror of war.”

Czubak believes that wartime letters can teach us patience and give us the confidence and hope necessary to endure the worst of circumstances. “We are currently facing a serious threat,” he said, “but we must keep our cool and the [potential] impacts must be put into perspective given the ordeal societies went through during the First and Second World Wars.”

Similar to Borden Wilson, Czubak believes that the act of writing a letter enables a person to thoughtfully convey their thoughts to others. “By writing letters, you take the time to step back and think. You don’t react to the moment, which helps to prevent the spread of panic and fake news.”

Re-reading my grandfather’s letters clarified all the things I was missing from my interactions on social media. My grandfather was remembered by many people as a difficult man, but his letters showed his generosity and humility. He strove to be better, without needing to be the best. And he practiced the advice many great writers give to their mentees: show, don’t tell.

My grandfather showed his future wife the world through his eyes. He gave her sunsets, and his words painted canals, wide open fields, trees reaching into the clear, blue sky. His descriptions enabled my grandmother to hold his world – idealised and ready to burst forth like a flower from a bud – in the palms of her hands.

American infantryman and historian Paul Fussell said the following about letters written during World War Two, and his thoughts are just as salient today: “Letters were a great comfort. And the mail was indispensable. We couldn’t have won the war without it. It was terribly important as a motivator of the troops. Mail call whenever it happened it was a delight.”

By writing letters, you take the time to step back and think

My grandfather’s wartime letters have inspired me to write letters of my own. Like his letters, mine offer nothing educational, nothing too smart. They are simply a way to help me stay connected to my family and friends during a dark moment in our collective human history, and they serve to quiet the cacophony produced via digital communications. Social media seems akin to the fear of God: it is everywhere; it is pervasive; and it stifles any love we might feel. Letters, however, encapsulate a moment, immortalising forever the slices of life that make us the most human. It is in these small moments that I feel closest to my fellow humans and feel the spark of the divine.

What are the things I hope future generations will learn about these difficult times? Some doctors and politicians compare treating the virus to fighting an invisible enemy, and I’ve wondered how my grandparents might have responded to the recent statement made by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who said that the health crisis is the greatest challenge for the world since World War Two. Having spent so much time reading my grandfather’s wartime letters, I suspect they might have written about the budding love they felt for each other, and then used that love to bolster themselves during their daily lives, no matter what lay ahead.

I don’t have all the answers, but I hope future generations will remember the myriad ways people held each other up, rather than how they smartly held each other accountable on social media. With this thought in mind, my handwritten letters serve only to momentarily disrupt the gravitas of the illness and death filling our world with silly stories, descriptions of what I’m making for dinner and narratives of the remarkable world I see through my window. I look forward to the day when I can mark the end of the coronavirus crisis by sending a letter similar to my grandfather’s telegram: ""DARLING BE HOME BEFORE BREAKFAST”.

For now, letters like the one I sent this morning to my mother and stepfather will have to suffice:

“Dear Mama and Alan, I’ve taken to staring out of my window at the Verrazzano Bridge, which spans the Narrows, a wide tidal straight separating my neighborhood in Brooklyn with Staten Island. I imagine that this letter is also a bridge, allowing my words to span the space between my small apartment to your living room in Rhode Island.”

Protected within a Unesco World Heritage landscape, Quinta da Regaleira is a postcard-perfect mix of Gothic, Egyptian, Moorish and Renaissance architecture. But it’s what lies beneath the palace’s gardens that truly sets the estate’s design apart. A pair of wells, called the Initiation Wells, spiral down deep within the earth, like inverted towers. The wells were never used to collect water. Instead, they were part of a mysterious initiation ritual within the Knights of Templar tradition.

This media cannot be played on your device.

Quinta da Regaleira has had many owners over the decades, but it was António Augusto Carvalho Monteiro, one of the wealthiest men in Portugal at the turn of the 20th Century, who made the estate what it is today.

Carvalho Monteiro had a deep interest in – and was quite possibly an initiate of – the Knights Templar, a Catholic military order with roots dating to the early 12th Century. While the group is believed to have disbanded 700 years ago, certain groups, like the Freemasons, revived the medieval group’s rituals and traditions centuries later. With architect and set designer Luigi Manini, Carvalho Monteiro created a property brimming with pagan and Christian symbolism between 1904 and 1910. The property’s wells, located in the expansive gardens that Manini also designed, served as the starting point in Templar candidate initiation ceremonies.

It is believed that Templar initiations at Quinta da Regaleira began with candidates entering one of the Initiation Wells blindfolded. Holding a sword close to their heart, they would descend nine flights of stairs – a number that represents the nine founders of the Templar order. Once reaching the bottom of the well, the candidate would walk into a dark labyrinth where they would symbolically and literally find their way up towards the light. If they were able to make back through the well tower and into the sunlight, initiates would walk across stones in water to reach the chapel, where they would then be welcomed into the brotherhood.

While Templar initiations no longer take place at Quinta da Regaleira, visitors are welcomed trace the footsteps of candidates past, experiencing this ode to Portugal’s hidden myths and history firsthand.

247,How the humble potato changed the world,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200302-the-true-origins-of-the-humble-potato,['Diego Arguedas Ortiz'],"In his 1957 essay collection Mythologies, the French philosopher and literary critic Roland Barthes called chips (la frite), a food that comes from a crop native to the Americas, “patriotic” and “the alimentary sign of Frenchness”.

Despite its origins in the Andes, it’s an incredibly successful global food

Just a century earlier, a potato disease prompted a famine that halved Ireland’s population in a few years, producing a decades-long cascading effect of social and economic turmoil. And as you read these lines, the world’s leading potato producers today are China, India, Russia and Ukraine, respectively.

Despite these nations’ intimate and complicated relationships with potatoes, and how intertwined their societies and economies are with them, none can truly call them native. The humble potato was domesticated in the South American Andes some 8,000 years ago and was only brought to Europe in the mid-1500s, from where it spread west and northwards, back to the Americas, and beyond.

“Despite its origins in the Andes, it’s an incredibly successful global food,” said food historian Rebecca Earle, who’s tracing the potato’s planetary journey in a forthcoming book called Feeding the People: The Politics of the Potato. “It’s grown practically everywhere in the world, and practically everywhere, people consider it one of ‘our foods’.”

For the rest of the world beyond the Andes, the potato might not be autochthonous, but it feels local. Earle calls it the “world's most successful immigrant”, as its origin has become unrecognisable for producers and consumers everywhere. Idaho farmers in the US and gnocchi-loving Italians will claim the potato as much as any Peruvian, because its story is not only that of a country or of a region, but an account of how humans have reconfigured their relationship with land and food within a few generations.

The potato is the world’s fourth-most important crop after rice, wheat and maize, and the first among non-grains. How could an Andean tuber persuade the world, in just a few centuries, to adopt it so completely? What made the potato so irresistible was its unrivalled nutritional value, its relative easiness to cultivate as compared to some major cereals, its ability to easily navigate wars and tax censuses due to its knack for hiding underground from collectors, and in particular, its camaraderie with working men and women in the fields.

A good place to understand its origins is the Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP), or International Potato Center, a research-for-development centre that researches and promotes all things potato-related.

It’s set in an arid suburb in the Peruvian capital, Lima, and harbours a collection of thousands of potato samples from across the continent. “The Andes is where the biggest genetic diversity lies, but you can find potatoes from Chile to the United States,” René Gómez, senior curator at the CIP genebank, told me there.

He explained that potatoes were domesticated high in the Andes, near Lake Titicaca, nearly 1,000km south-east of Lima. Following domestication, these early potatoes spread through the cordillera and became a crucial food supply for indigenous communities, including the Inca, particularly as a staple foodstuff called chuño, a freeze-dried potato product that can last years or even decades.

Out of the Americas

In 1532, the Spanish invasion brought an end to the Inca but not to the cultivation of potatoes. The invaders took tubers (the underground parts of the plant we call potatoes) across the Atlantic, as they did with other crops such as tomatoes, avocados and corn, in what historians call the Great Columbian Exchange. For the first time in history, the potato ventured beyond the Americas.

These early Andean varieties had a tough time adjusting to Spain and other parts of mainland Europe. Day length is very constant across the year in the equatorial region where potatoes first were domesticated, so the potato plant was used to regular days with 12 hours of sunlight, said evolutionary geneticist Hernan A Burbano Roa.

European long summer days confused the potato plant, and tubers didn’t grow during the favourable warmer months; instead, they did so in the autumn, too close to the frosty early winter days to survive. The first decades of planting in the Old Continent proved unsuccessful.

But then potatoes found better conditions in Ireland, where a cool but frost-free fall gave the crop enough time to mature after its introduction from Spain in the 1580s. A century of farmer selection produced a variety that set tubers earlier in the summer, and the potato took the mantle it would carry for centuries: the staple crop of peasants.

The humble tuber

Villagers prized potatoes because they provided an unmatched nutritional yield per hectare. In Ireland in particular, tenants rented the land they tilled, so as lords increased their fees, they were forced to produce as much food as possible in the smallest possible area. “No crop produced more food per acre, demanded less cultivation and stored as easily as the potato,” wrote sociologist James Lang in his book Notes of a Potato Watcher.

Potatoes contain nearly every important vitamin and nutrient, except vitamins A and D, making their life-supporting properties unrivalled by any other single crop. Keep their skin and add some dairy, which provides the two missing vitamins, and you have a healthy human diet staple. You even have 2g of protein for every 100g of potato; eat 5.5 kilos per adult per day, if one’s to believe some estimates of consumption in mid-1600s Ireland, and you have a good supply.

For landless tenants in 17th- and 18th-Century Ireland, a single acre of land cultivated with potatoes and one milk cow was nutritionally sufficient for feeding a large family of six to eight. No cereal could claim that feat. Thus, began the centuries-long captivation among Irish and British peasants with the potato, grounded in rented earth and scarcity.

From the British Isles, potatoes spread eastwards across peasant fields in Northern Europe, writes Lang: they were found in the Low Countries by 1650, in Germany, Prussia and Poland by 1740 and in Russia by 1840s. After farmer-selection filtered out those varieties and genes less adapted to local climate conditions, it flourished.

Villagers in the war-ravaged European plains, by conflicts such as the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War, quickly discovered another advantage of planting potatoes: they were really hard to tax and plunder. “If you have a field of wheat, it’s really visible. You can’t hide it”, said Earle, who claims tax collectors can visually measure their size and return in time for the harvest. But underground potatoes are well hidden, and you can dig them up one by one, as needed. “Such piecemeal harvesting hid the crop from tax collectors and protected the peasant’s food supply in the war time,” said Lang in his book. “Marauding soldiers laid waste to field crops and raided grain stores. They rarely stopped to dig up an acre of spuds.”

The elites and military strategists of the time noticed this. Prussia’s King Frederick the Great ordered his government to distribute instructions on how to plant potatoes, hoping peasants would have food if enemy armies invaded during the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740. Other nations followed suit and by the time of the Napoleonic wars in the early 1800s, the potato had become Europe’s food reserve, according to a report by the Food and Agriculture Association of the United Nations (FAO).

In fact, tubers were such a valued crop during wartime that “every military campaign on European soil after about 1560 resulted in an increase in potato acreage, down to and including World War Two,” wrote historian William McNeill in his 1999 essay How the Potato Changed the World's History.

Nutrition and power

In a matter of centuries, potatoes entered the European and global economies as a staple crop. For decades, food historians (such as those noted in this FAO booklet from 2008) have explained this spread as the result of well-meaning Enlightened sages obsessed with the nutritional properties of the tubers that managed to persuade a reluctant and conservative populace to adopt the potato.

But Earle has her doubts. It was peasants who adapted the potato to Europe, she argues, thus they needed no persuading. Elites did not discover a new crop, but rather, they had a novel idea of what healthy food was. Instead of placing a “superfood” in the middle of European diet, they realised that nutrition needed to take a more central role and looked around for those crops that might serve their purpose. The humble tuber was already there.

Enlightened discussions of “population”, and what its health meant for the power of the state, changed political calculations during the 18th Century, and also the fortunes of the potato. If a strong, numerous population was crucial for economic production and military might, the state needed to understand and manage the nutritional components of what people were eating. Abundant, healthy food became central to Empire-building, Earle writes in her 2018 paper Promoting Potatoes in Eighteenth-Century Europe. Thus, she argues, the fascination with potatoes does not come from the emergence of a new crop, but from novel European ideas of the relationship between food and the state.

In this regard, the potato was unrivalled. “The food produced by a field of potatoes is… much superior to what is produced by a field of wheat,” wrote Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations. “No food can afford a more decisive proof of its nourishing quality, or of its being peculiarly suitable to the health of the human constitution.” But while Smith was right in highlighting the potato’s virtues, it was peasants and not the elites that made potatoes a fixture of European gardens and farms.

A question of measuring arises, Earle admits. How did scholars like Smith and his contemporaries compare nutritional value? In the 18th Century, scientists hadn’t agreed on a language for vitamins, proteins and minerals, she said. Instead, “what they did is say: ‘look at the people who eat potatoes. They are more robust, and they are stouter and more energetic than people who eat other things’,” said the scholar, who heads the Department of History at the University of Warwick.

But as she argues, potatoes served this state-building purpose not only because of their nutritional value, but because they were already planted in gardens and fields across the continent. Its fans praised its virtues.

Potatoes, by feeding rapidly growing populations, permitted a handful of European nations to assert dominion over most of the world

They were not wrong. A widely cited economics paper reviewed information from military records of French soldiers born after 1700 and showed that eating potatoes made people slightly taller. According to The Quarterly Journal of Economics: for villages that were fully suitable for potato cultivation, its introduction increased average adult heights by approximately one-half inch.

That same paper provides a stronger claim: that population in Europe and Asia exploded after the spread of the potato. According to the researchers, the tuber introduction accounts for close to one-quarter of the growth in Old World population and urbanisation between 1700 and 1900.

“Potatoes, by feeding rapidly growing populations, permitted a handful of European nations to assert dominion over most of the world between 1750 and 1950,” wrote McNeill.

Back to the Andes

The potato frenzy continued unstoppably until a blight paved the way for the Great Famine of 1845-1849 in Ireland. The failure of the crop, compounded by the utterly inadequate response by the British Government in London (which decided against relief and bet on market forces), led to the death of a million people, the emigration of one million people to the US and the steady departure of two more million elsewhere. Ireland’s population was halved in a matter of decades.

The Famine called attention to the fact that potato had supplied 80% of calorie intake in the country with only a handful of crop varieties available. Such a homogenous food block made the potato susceptible to diseases, as its genetic diversity had been washed away from domestication.

To be fair, some mixing of varieties had already taken place in Europe around the 1750s. Burbano was part of a team that peered into the genes of European potatoes to study their ancestry and concluded that ancient Andean varieties mixed with tubers later brought from the lowlands of south-central Chile, such as Chiloé island, were naturally domesticated for the long days of the Southern Hemisphere.

This first admixture only provides some handy traits, but not enough genetic depth, so breeding programmes over the years have been looking at ways to improve food security for potato farmers. “One of the ways breeders used to incorporate resistance was looking at wild potatoes,” Burbano explained, talking about inedible potato cousins that still survive in the Andes and in the rest of their natural range. There are 151 known species, and they are the ancestors of today’s potatoes, which have lost genetic diversity after centuries of serving humans.

In the early decades of the 20th Century, scientists began combining genes from mainstream potatoes, hoping to keep their domesticated traits, with wild potatoes, hoping to get their resistance to diseases. Most tubers grown today are a result of such tests.

These wild species might also provide an answer to another pressing issue: changing temperature and rain conditions due to the climate crisis. A recent study concluded that rising emissions could cause a reduction of up to 26% of global tuber yield reductions by 2085. Genetic resources from these species could provide desirable traits, such as tolerance to frost, drought or temperature increase.

Breeders in Europe and the United States, and more recently in Asia, have been developing these more resistant varieties for years, paving the way for potatoes to become a truly global crop in the 20th Century. Of the world’s top 20 tuber producers, only three (the United States, Peru and Brazil) are part of its historical range, but every country is creating its own connection to it.

In China, the government is aggressively promoting the potato among its population, hoping it can become a new national staple crop and staple food. Its leaders are following similar tactics to those of 18th-Century Europe, peddling it with state-owned media, popular figures and popular science books. And in India, potatoes are prepared in hundreds of different ways and you would struggle to convince farmers that they aren’t local.

Half the world around, the potato has reignited long-standing rivalries between Peru and Chile over who can claim the tuber as their own, while top chefs in Lima and the Andes – such as Virgilio Martinez who opened Mil in 2019 – are turning their gaze again to potatoes and featuring them in their creations.

While Peruvians insist that potatoes were domesticated in what’s now their territory (and bits of neighbouring Bolivia), a Chilean minister countered in 2008 that a vast majority of the world’s tubers come from a variety introduced from Chile. But the debate is not necessarily about a history lesson, but also about national pride. “The silly part is that the story of the potato began millennia before the concept of nation-states existed,” said Charles Crissman, a researcher at the International Potato Center, in a New York Times story published in 2008. “But, yes, the first potatoes came from what is today Peru.”

The claims rankled Peruvians because it came during the International Year of the Potato in 2008, a celebration that even FAO conceded “came from the Government of Peru”. The country established the International Potato Center in 1971 and worked with indigenous communities in the mountain peaks to protect the potato’s genetic heritage.

A small agri-park high in the Peruvian Andes, the Potato Park in Cusco harbours a living museum of the humble tuber, in their natural environment, a reminder of where the potato comes from, but also a roadmap of where it could go: genetic material from less domesticated potatoes can trace a path forward for the crop, as it deals with new threats such as changing climates and pressures on the agricultural sector.

A two-hour drive east of Cusco, a different view of the present and the future awaits: it’s Mil, an ambitious take on Peruvian culinary tradition perched 12,000ft up in the clouds of the Andean mountains. Thanks to its celebrated chefs, here you can try a handful of Peru’s almost 5,000 species of potatoes, and still have some space to wonder about what’s beyond these mountains: is it an Indian curry? Fish and chips in an east London pub? A baked potato fresh from an Idaho oven?

With the global versatility of potatoes, the possibilities are endless.

249,Why First Nations communities are uninviting visitors,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200525-why-first-nations-communities-are-uninviting-visitors,['Diane Selkirk'],"The idea of Covid-19 entering the remote First Nation’s community of Bella Bella terrifies Marilyn Slett, chief councillor of the Heiltsuk Tribal Council. Located on British Columbia’s (BC) central coast, the water- and air-access only community of 1,400 is a gateway to Canada’s Great Bear Rainforest, a region the size of Ireland that’s famed for its eco-tourism opportunities.

One of 198 distinct First Nations in BC, each with its own unique traditions and history, the Heiltsuk Nation has spent years revitalising and preserving its culture. The long process reached a milestone with the November 2019 opening of the community’s first Big House (where the Heiltsuk gathered for sacred communal events) to be built in 200 years, and more plans are in the future. But, as it does in many Indigenous communities, the future takes its cues from the past. And Covid-19, which is particularly dangerous to older people, therefore puts the community’s future at risk.

“Our laws and traditions are oral,” said Slett. “They’re passed down by our Knowledge Keepers,” a group of Elders who have learned the Nation’s customs, traditions and protocols. “We only have 30 fluent Hailhzaqvla-speaking Elders left,” she added. “We’ll uphold Heiltsuk laws and do everything we can to protect them.”

Slett is referring to the emergency measures her community has put in place. Like many Indigenous communities in coastal BC, and around the world, the Heiltsuk Nation has enacted a strict lockdown, opting to go well beyond the provincial guidelines by banning all non-essential travel in or out of their territory.

On the roads and in the public ferry terminals leading into the normally tourist-friendly communities on BC’s coast, checkpoints have been set up, manned by Guardian Watchmen who typically act as friendly ambassadors and cultural interpreters. Out on the water, these Guardians are using AIS (Automatic Identification System) to identify, track and intercept any boat that arrives in their waters. Their role is to ensure the vessel should be there and turn it back if it’s not. Shifted to a new frontline, these traditional protectors, stewards and guardians of First Nations lands and waters have begun rediscovering the power of protecting a Nation’s greatest treasure: its people.

Canada’s Indigenous people have always been stewards of their land and culture – but what’s changed is how they now combine Western science and law with cultural knowledge and traditional laws to secure their survival. Often, the weight of this combination is directed towards things like sovereignty claims; archaeology has been used to secure land claims. But now communities, who cherish their Elders for the guidance they provide, are listening to international health guidelines and then combining that knowledge with their own values in the way that protects the community best.

It’s not difficult to understand why the Heiltsuk have opted to manage the pandemic by following the advice of their own leaders and shutting off their community to outsiders. For 14,000 years, they have lived in balance within a territory that spans about 15,540 sq km and extends through the Great Bear Rainforest. Heiltsuk historians estimate that at their cultural peak, as many as 20,000 people lived in 50 summer and winter villages set in ancient forests of huge Sitka spruce, red cedar, western hemlock and Douglas fir.

European contact, dating from the 1780s, brought devastation. “We survived smallpox, we survived measles, we survived government policy,” Slett said. But the onslaught took its toll. In the 1880s, the remnants of the severely depleted Heiltsuk communities gathered into one village near Bella Bella: their population had been diminished to around 200 people.

And then the 1918 flu came. “My mom told me about my grandmother who remembered the ladies crying and talking about all of the losses. There were whole households passing away – and no time for proper burials,” said Slett.

Cultural devastation wasn’t unique to the Heiltsuk. In many Indigenous tourism offerings in Canada, that painful and turbulent journey is something visitors learn about. “Our most effective businesses are built around sharing culture and cultural revitalisation,” said Keith Henry, president and CEO of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada.

Since time immemorial, Guardians have had a role in managing land and water and in exerting rights

More than opportunities to see wildlife, hear songs or learn how people create art or survive off the land; modern Indigenous tourism in Canada is a $1.8bn industry that combines experiences with culture in a way that celebrates the warmth, humour and resilience of Indigenous people.

“It’s not Disney-fying us, it’s not making us like a petting zoo; it’s really just sharing who we are,” said Henry.

Located 55km north of Bella Bella, the Kitasoo / Xai'xais Nations village of Klemtu is also on lockdown. Chief councillor Roxanne Robinson says the decision to close the community to outsiders was an obvious one, as “protecting the health and safety of people is the work of a leader”.

The rugged landscape and wildlife, which includes whales, coastal wolves, black bears, grizzly bears and the spirit bear, attracts visitors from all over the world and makes up a vital part of the local economy. Robinson says that closing their community in mid-March was a hard choice, but it was just in time. Just south, Heiltsuk Watchmen on the water reported they started turning back yachts. American and Canadian boaters trying to flee big cities and those who wanted to hunt or fish (which is considered essential in BC, but not by the coastal communities) had started heading for more remote, Covid-19­-free communities.

In normal times, these Guardian Watchmen would ensure people knew to stay away from sacred sites and to follow wildlife regulations.

A global concern Inadequate healthcare and higher rates of chronic health conditions means indigenous communities around the world are at greater risk from Covid-19. Argentina: Home to at least 35 officially recognised indigenous communities, some have opted to insulate themselves from outsiders.

Australia: Some remote indigenous communities locked themselves down early. They were quickly supported by the federal government, which is using its Biosecurity Act to limit access to essential staff and services.

Brazil: With 850,000 indigenous people, different groups are responding with strict isolation; guarding their communities from outsiders and using traditional treatments.

Kenya: Maasai people have traditionally survived pandemics by isolating deeper into their territory. During Covid-19, many people are currently scattered and isolated.

US: The Navajo Nation is one of the epicentres of the virus in the US and currently has the highest infection rates in the country.

“They are an extension of nationhood,” said Claire Hutton, Indigenous Stewardship Director at conservation organisation Nature United. “Since time immemorial, Guardians have had a role in managing land and water and in exerting rights.”

In earlier Kitasoo / Xai'xais villages, Robinson said, there was always one Guardian Watchman situated outside the village to watch for strangers. While in the Heiltsuk culture, the Guardian Watchmen were informal custodians of the land and water, following traditional laws to protect food sources and conserve the landscape.

While the ancient tradition faded with colonisation, modern Guardian Watchmen programmes came into being in the 1980s with programmes in Haida Gwaii, 200km west of Bella Bella, and in the Innu territories in Labrador. Today more than 50 different programmes in Nations across Canada fulfil a wide variety of different roles, depending on what a community may need.

Hutton, who coordinates a team that provides technical support to Guardians across Canada, says the programmes are as distinct as the Nations themselves, but there are common themes and issues. Many are focused on stewardship and ensuring the protection of traditional food sources. Some have a strong science focus, and Guardians are critical for data collection and monitoring biodiversity or species at risk. Other programmes concentrate on tourism and the Guardians act as interpreters.

The goal of Nature United is to support the Guardians with resources that match their requirements. But manning checkpoints to prevent the spread of Covid-19 has brought up an unexpected set of needs. “Offering conflict training and Tactical Communications webinars is new,” Hutton said.

As the Guardian Watchmen shift from scientific data gathering and land preservation to guarding the frontlines, they’ve encountered pushback from travellers who question their authority. While British Columbia’s Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation agree that First Nations have the authority to restrict travel into their communities, at the same time the province, like many places, has begun reopening, forcing Indigenous communities to protect themselves.

Slett says while it would be better if Canada and BC reinforced Indigenous restrictions, the communities have the knowledge they need and are ready to safeguard themselves.

Following traditional laws, which focus on balancing the needs of the people, the environment and the economy, coastal Nations, which battled each other in ancient times, have come together. In an effort to keep out outsiders, Haida Gwaii and the Central and North Coast, including the Heiltsuk and Kitasoo / Xai'xais Nations, have set up a coalition. They are working collectively to let visitors know that while they are valued and wanted, now is not the time to visit. The communities are simply too vulnerable to risk any loss.

We are self-isolating at this time so that when we gather again, nobody is left behind

“We know that this isn’t over and it’s going to be a few years before there’s a vaccination and it’s no longer a threat to humankind,” Slett said. “Indigenous communities cannot be left on the sidelines and on the fringes of what’s going on. We need to work together as we uphold our measures.”

Meanwhile the Heiltsuk – and other locked-down communities that have closed their borders ­– have turned inward. “We have Guardian Watchmen that are out there daily. We also have a patrol that monitors the entry points of the community,” said Slett. “And we’re turning to our Knowledge Keepers to see what we can do in terms of adapting during this period.”

What the Knowledge Keepers are teaching is the value of self-sufficiency. All along the coast, communities are relying more heavily on traditional marine foods like eulachon oil, smoked salmon, fresh herring eggs and roasted seaweed. Community gardens are being started and leaders are encouraging people to find strength in the power of looking after themselves.

“If you look through our histories, I can’t imagine our ancestors or our leadership of 30, 40, 50, 100 years ago having the kind of confidence to determine our future this directly,” said Henry. While the financial implications of shutting down tourism will hurt communities, he added, the whole point of tourism all along has been to strengthen the culture: Nations making their own decisions does that.

Slett said that they want tourists, they want visitors, but later. Right now, they need to get everyone through the pandemic safely: “One of our staff members posted this on Facebook: “We are self-isolating at this time so that when we gather again, nobody is left behind.”

253,Victory gardens: A war-time hobby that’s back in fashion,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200524-victory-gardens-a-war-time-hobby-thats-back-in-fashion,['Ellie Howard'],"It was late March when the UK lockdown was first announced. Around the same time, I ordered a seedling tray and two packets of “Cut ‘n’ Come Again” leafy greens: arugula, rucola, oriental mustard, pak choy and borecole. Nearly two months later, lockdown still hasn’t been lifted, but my tufty lettuce leaves have shot up. For billions, globally, the Covid-19 pandemic has spelt a period of deep uncertainty and stagnation, but watching green miracles occur in my vegetable patch has been reassuring. I’m not alone in thinking so.

The early weeks of the pandemic threw the global supply chain into disarray, setting off a wave of stockpiling. The US saw a spike in alternative milk sales, Australia lacked flour on supermarket shelves, pasta was scarce in Italy and eggs in Britain. Many countries reported fears of labour shortages for perishables such as fresh vegetables, according to Time magazine. As with any crisis, people have been quick to take matters into their own hands – as highlighted by soaring seed sales.

• A British feast from garden weeds

• The dish that ended the plague

• A dish born from the bomb

A recent report by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows 42% of Britons have taken to gardening to cope with lockdown, while a third of a million searched for tips on growing garden variety crops on the Royal Horticultural Society website – the most popular being the humble potato. Across the UK and beyond, people are digging in their backyards, potting plants on balconies or using windowsills as suntraps for seedlings.

The rush to grow-your-own has sparked comparisons to ‘victory gardening’. Dug either side of the Atlantic, from North America to Great Britain and further afield in Australia, these kitchen gardens became popularised in World War One and World War Two when shortages reached critical levels in the Allied nations. In response, governments coordinated domestic campaigns calling upon citizens to fuel the war effort and feed the country. Working the soil became a patriotic duty.

In the UK, most widely remembered is the “Dig for Victory” campaign launched by the British Ministry of Agriculture in 1939. It was so successful that the number of allotments grew to 1.7 million in just three years, while private gardens with vegetable produce numbered five million.

Food prices are going up, and fresh produce is going to be at a premium

During the same period, a horticultural magazine paraphrased Napoleon’s claim that the English were a nation of shopkeepers, instead writing: “We might with equal justice be called a nation of gardeners”. The claim stuck. Our obsession with gardening stretches far beyond a national pastime; it is rooted in the British psyche. The garden is considered a private sanctuary but also a site of creative expression and personal pride, as reflected in the highly competitive British annual “giant vegetable” competitions that spring up from Harrogate to Carmarthenshire. For Britons, growing our own produce has the added value of bringing locals together.

Victory gardens were also not just about food: cultivating fruit and vegetables boosted morale and built momentum. Growing for the greater good banded together communities and enabled those stuck at home to play a part, however small. Perhaps this is why the gardens’ legacy can still be felt today. While using the analogy of war to describe a viral pandemic is controversial, it makes sense that we‘ve connected the two moments in time. It is the sense of community spirit we want to revive – and a victory garden quite literally says we are in this together.

Beyond caring for our own families, green-fingered types are sharing produce with their neighbours. A survey commissioned by the British charity RSA cited that 42% of respondents feel the outbreak has made them value food more, and 10% have shared supplies for the first time.

I first noticed the neighbourly potential of plants three weeks after lockdown had begun, when a neighbour I hardly knew knocked on the door of my house in Suffolk. When I answered, she leapt behind the gate: “Alpine strawberries,” she yelled, “Plant them in partial shade”. A week later, a trio of pepper seedlings appeared – another gift. To say thank you, I delivered fat garlicky leaves of wild ransom, foraged between bluebells in a nearby woodland. Now, we swap excited texts about her egg-laying tortoise, Rosie. Since then, I check what Jeanie and her husband, John, would like from the shops; why I waited for a pandemic to do this is beyond me.

Outside their gate, a sign offers willowherb and more wild strawberries – anything surplus they don’t need. “If someone likes something in your garden, you can just take a cutting for them,” John said. “It doesn’t cost you anything.”

The Bristol Seed Swap has been promoting the circular economy of seed saving for years. A few days after lockdown, they advertised leftover seed packets from a previous event, which the public could request free of charge by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope. Diane Holness, a spokesperson for the non-profit, said swells of gardeners were in touch with requests. “We sent seeds to around 150 people,” she said. “I think everyone is aware that food prices are going up, and that fresh produce is going to be at a premium.”

The most requested seeds were tomato; adaptable and easy to grow. “I think they are one crop that can fit into even the tiniest space, even a balcony,” she said.

Luckily, the organisation had plenty. As Holness said, harvesting seeds costs you nothing, but goes a long way to helping someone else: “If you know how, you could almost save enough cabbage seeds for everyone in the city.”

Two hours west of Bristol, West Dorset’s foodie capital, Bridport, has been a hive of activity since lockdown. Created in response to quarantine, the Bridport Grow Your Own community Facebook group has played a large role in greening the town. Just as the 1930s Dig for Victory leaflets relayed growing information, online groups are helping new growers by circulating plant wisdom.

“As a town, I think we are all at it,” environmentalist and educator Kim Squirrel told me. “People have dug up their gardens and others are growing in pots.” She works a private allotment on the town’s edge, shared between 10 houses, that includes her neighbour Rachel Millson. Both have turned their full attention to growing with news of the lockdown. Squirrel’s potager garden is crammed with brassicas alongside beans, French to dwarf, winding up bamboo stalks that are also home-grown. Pear and espalier apple trees will fruit come the summer.

Millson’s garden exploits are equally impressive: overwintering crops such as earthy beetroot, onion and leeks fill up one plot. Another bed is an experiment in perennial vegetables, such as asparagus, that take less carbon from the soil.

“The pandemic has cemented in my mind the need to be growing more food, not just for my own family and to save money, but for the wider community,” Millson said.

She feels fortunate to have an allotment, but wishes there was more recognition that growing your own food isn’t just a pastime but “real, important work”. Millson strongly believes it has personal benefits and also aids community wellbeing. Pre-empting that food inequality is going to be at an all-time high, she has purposefully grown extra vegetable crops with a mind to donate them to a local foodbank.

Part of the fun of growing your own produce is in sharing your hard-earned bounty with family and friends. But while delivering your overzealous courgette crop is practical, there is something special in giving someone a plant they can cultivate themselves.

We have common ground now, something other than the fear around the pandemic

Bruno White had just moved to Ditcheat, Somerset, when the UK went into lockdown on 23 March. He wrote to his new neighbours to introduce himself and set up an informal mutual aid group. One elderly gentleman he shopped for was so grateful that he left a collection of plants on White’s doorstep, each with handwritten instructions. Shortly afterwards, another thankful neighbour gifted him packets of biodynamic seeds: “He taught us about Three Sisters. It's a traditional Native American method. You grow corn, then beans to climb up it, then squash to shade and stifle any weeds.”

White has since been cultivating his garden and has been surprised at how easy it is – and how kind his neighbours are. “We have common ground now, something other than the fear around the pandemic,” he said.

While the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic were filled with panic, hopefully it will be the incredible displays of neighbourly spirit that we will remember. The victory garden movement of the World Wars not only helped strengthen communities, but also gave home-bound individuals a chance to contribute to those fighting on the front line. Amid a pandemic, the vegetable garden has similar appeal: it offers a sustainable solution to food security that not only helps us, but allows us to care for our neighbours too.

At a time of uncertainty and confusion, even planting a lettuce seed can offer a semblance of hope.

258,A mysterious US desert civilisation,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200521-a-mysterious-us-desert-civilisation,['Smoke'],"In the heart of the San Juan Basin, in the arid north-western corner of New Mexico, stands one of the greatest ancient treasures in the US: the remarkably preserved remains of a vast building complex believed to have been constructed between 850 and 1250AD that may have housed as many as 5,000 people. The high desert area of Chaco Canyon sees cold winters, scorching-hot summers and only about 22cm of rainfall every year. Yet, it was home to a thriving, yet mysterious, civilisation – the Chacoans, ancestors of the Puebloans.

In 1907, this isolated 53sq-mile expanse of desert became a national historical park, containing 13 major ruins and more than 400 archaeological sites. Pueblo Bonito, the largest excavated site, covers about 2 acres and has roughly 800 rooms arranged in a D-shaped building. The site was designed with sophisticated irrigation systems, the doorways are perfectly aligned with each other to facilitate communication and researchers estimate it housed about 2,000 people.

This media cannot be played on your device.

Today, visitors can wander around the same maze of chambers and roads used by its residents roughly 1,000 years ago. Some of the structures used to create the roofs and different floors are long gone, but their remains clearly reveal how they were built. Approximately 200,000 wooden pillars were used in the construction and were most likely hand-carried from the Chuska Mountains and Mount Taylor, more than 112km away.

The Chacoan roads are another impressive feature of the complex. There are about 650km of them, some 9m wide, built mostly in straight lines that cut through the rough topography instead of going around it. Their positioning, starting at a central structure and running towards notable natural elements, such as lakes and mountains, suggests they represented symbolic connections between man and nature. Yet, it doesn’t mean they weren’t practical: studies have shown that walking on those roads is less tiresome than walking on the rough terrain next to them.

Over the years, archaeologists have come up with different theories for why Chaco was built. Although the place seems to have been a trade hub, the buildings suggest it may also have been an important ceremonial site and point to the Chacoans’ impressive astronomical knowledge. The walls are aligned with the axis of the sunrise on an equinox and the north doorway faces almost exactly true north. Contemporary New Mexico Pueblo tribes, such as the Zuni, still consider Chaco Canyon a sacred site and they return there for ceremonies.

Since 1987, the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, along with other smaller Chaco sites, is a Unesco World Heritage site. For the past few years, one of the biggest threats to the site has been the oil and gas drilling and mining around Chaco Canyon. In 2019, the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act was introduced to the US Senate – if it passes, it will ban those activities within a 16km radius of the site.

264,Riz au lait: A simple French dish made from pantry staples,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200520-rice-pudding-a-simple-french-dish-made-from-pantry-staples,['Emily Monaco'],"Almost the moment that lockdown was announced in France, chefs started posting recipes for French comfort food desserts on Instagram, hoping to spread a bit of sweetness among their fellow citizens. But while crepes, yogurt cake and madeleines all certainly emerged, the recipe to feature most frequently, from the feed of Michelin-starred Stéphanie le Quellec to those of renowned pastry chefs Christophe Michalak and Yann Couvreur, was the humble riz au lait (rice pudding) – a custard-like dessert made by slowly cooking rice with milk and sugar.

A global comfort food While rice pudding exists in various forms around the globe, its very first apparition is hazy: some attribute it to China, while others point to the Indian subcontinent. East Asian iterations include simple sweet congee or the aptly named “eight treasures” steamed pudding, flavoured with a variety of fruits and sweet bean paste. In India, meanwhile, kheer has been enjoyed since ancient times, associated with Hindu god Shiva and with Ayurvedic therapies. Today, nearly every culture around the world has its own version: baked or boiled, spiced or sweetened with fruit. Latin American arroz con leche is often made with condensed milk and spices; in Indonesia, black glutinous rice is the base for bubur ketan hitan. In Scandinavia, tradition even demands that a bowl be left out for mischief-making Christmas elves.

“It’s really a childhood dessert in French culture,” said Marine Gora, co-founder of Gramme restaurant in Paris. “I’d say everyone probably has a childhood memory associated with riz au lait.”

According to culinary historian Patrick Rambourg, riz au lait has long featured on French tables – if not specifically as a comfort food dessert, or even a dessert at all. While riz au lait recipes date as far back as the 14th Century, the concoction, then often made with broth (or almond milk on lean days when the Catholic Church forbade meat and dairy), was usually served to the bedridden or ailing thanks to its nourishing qualities and digestibility. But above all, riz au lait was generally a dish served to the aristocracy.

“Rice was still rare, at that time,” said Rambourg. “Very rare. And so, it was mainly eaten by the rich.”

It was probably because of this association with the upper crust that riz au lait soon took on a sweeter profile, seasoned with saffron and sugar – both of which were rare and expensive, at the time.

By the 16th Century, however, rice began to become more common in France – and in Europe in general – and riz au lait thus started to appear on more modest tables, notably among peasants in the French countryside, albeit only for holiday meals. When beet sugar became popular in France in the 19th Century, thereby making it a more commonplace sweetener even on modest tables, riz au lait slowly but surely became something that those from all walks of life could enjoy, from a simple dessert sweetened only with sugar to more elaborate riz à l’impératrice with candied fruits and alcohol.

The idea of riz au lait being a childhood dessert, then, is one that appeared “very recently,” Rambourg said. As for how exactly that came to be, the waters are murky. Perhaps it comes from the familiarity of its ingredients; perhaps from its digestibility, or the pureness of its white colour, or just from its ease.

But for Rambourg, there’s not one simple answer.

“I think there’s something else behind it… something that isn’t always easy to explain,” he said. “There are recipes that evoke feelings far more than flavour, perhaps.”

While riz au lait is firmly ensconced in the nostalgic, comfort food category of “recettes de grand-mère” (literally, “grandmother’s recipes”), in many French families today, riz au lait is more often eaten out of a store-bought plastic pot than served out of a fancy copper saucepan.

“Often, it’s pretty poorly made,” said Gora. “It’s not creamy, it’s kind of overly compact.”

Some homemade recipes up the ante by folding in whipped cream or egg yolks for richness, while others spice it up with vanilla, cinnamon or caramel. When professional chefs put their hand to the dish, however, it is often to add contemporary textural contrast. Gora’s version calls for caramel-coated puffed rice atop the creamy pudding.

“Whenever you’re building a dish, you always try to look for different textures, so a bit of crunch,” said Gora. “It came to me naturally: the crispy, caramelised rice with a touch of caramel.”

Her recipe is unsurprisingly quite popular among her clients. And while it’s not on her regular menu, patrons make frequent requests for its appearance.

“Whenever anyone asks for it, I always make it the next day!” she said.

Chef Stéphane Jégo, too, opted to include a crunchy caramel topping when he created a version at his 7th-arrondissement Paris restaurant Chez L’Ami Jean 16 years ago. To hear Jégo tell it, he never intended for the riz au lait to remain on the menu quite so long. He was just looking for a nostalgic dessert he could serve that was easy to prepare in advance.

“I wanted something that hearkened back to childhood,” he said, “and to this idea of communal dining.”

His riz au lait has three components: the pudding itself; a creamy caramel made with salted Brittany butter; and house-made nougatine with nuts enrobed in a crunchy caramel coating (see recipe below). Served by the generous bowlful with a wooden spoon, it quickly became the star of Jégo’s menu.

“There’s this regressive side to it, where you get to the end of the meal, and the riz au lait comes, and the first thing everyone says is, ‘Oh, it’s way too much!’,” Jégo said, laughing. “And then it’s just like… oh, one spoon, two spoons, three spoons… and all of a sudden, the bowl is empty.”

Now, Jégo said, he couldn’t take it off the menu, even if he wanted to. “It’s crazy: I get stopped in the street, even abroad, for riz au lait.

“That, to me, is worth all the stars in the world. Because it means you’ve touched people. You’ve got to the heart of what good food can bring to people, and to pleasure, and to memory,” he said.

During confinement, Jégo has prepared 200 litres of riz au lait for hungry Parisians to take away and enjoy at home.

“I don’t really think mine is any better than anyone else’s. It’s the orchestration. The generosity. You’ve got this childlike zeal that just… takes over,” he said, as he stirred the caramel for his most recent batch.

“People just need that comfort.”

Stéphane Jégo’s Riz au Lait Recipe



Rice Pudding

2.5l milk

1 vanilla bean, split

500g short-grain rice

500g sugar

1l cream (Jégo uses Normandy cream)

Heat the milk and the vanilla bean. Add the rice and cook 40 minutes over low heat. When the rice is tender enough to crush between your fingers, add the sugar, and cook 15 minutes more. Remove the vanilla bean and chill the pudding in the fridge.

Whip the cream to medium peaks. Remove the rice from the fridge and use a spoon to break it up and loosen it. Fold in the whipped cream.

Nougatine

250g pistachios

250g walnuts

250g almonds (toasted in the oven with 3 dabs of butter)

125g unsalted butter

190g turbinado sugar

In a saucepan over medium heat, make a light brown caramel with the butter and the sugar. Add the walnuts and the pistachios, and then toss them in the caramel until well coated. Pour everything onto a lined baking sheet containing the toasted almonds, and then set aside to cool.

Salted Caramel

600g heavy cream, plus 25ml for whipping

125g salted butter (Jégo uses Brittany butter)

600g sugar

37g flaky sea salt (Jégo uses fleur de sel)

5½ gelatine sheets, 2g each

In a saucepan over medium heat, make a dark brown caramel with the sugar and the butter. Off the heat, add the cream, sea salt flakes and gelatine. Cook for 30 minutes over low heat. Set aside in the fridge.

Whip the cream to stiff peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into the caramel.

When the nougatine has cooled, break it up into bite-sized pieces. Serve the pudding, caramel and nougatine in serving bowls, so that each diner can assemble his or her own portion.

“We caught the bears as cubs and raised them as a member of the family. They shared our food and lived in our village. When the time came, we set one free back into nature and killed the other to eat.”

Having treated the bear well in life, her people believe the spirit of the sacred animal, which they worship as a deity, will ensure the continued good fortune of their community.

Kimiko Naraki is 70 but looks decades younger. She is Ainu, an indigenous people who now live mostly on Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island, but whose lands once spanned from northern Honshu (the Japanese mainland) north to Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands (which are now a disputed part of the Russian Federation). The Ainu have long been of interest to anthropologists because of their cultural, linguistic and physical identity, but most travellers will not have heard of them. That’s because although they were the earliest settlers of Hokkaido, they were oppressed and marginalised by Japanese rule for centuries.

The Ainu have had a difficult history. Their origins are murky, but some scholars believe they are descendants of an indigenous population that once spread across northern Asia. The Ainu called Hokkaido “Ainu Moshiri” (“Land of the Ainu”), and their original occupation was hunting, foraging and fishing, like many indigenous people across the world. They mainly lived along Hokkaido’s warmer southern coast and traded with the Japanese. But after the Meiji Restoration (about 150 years ago), people from mainland Japan started emigrating to Hokkaido as Japan colonised the northernmost island, and discriminatory practices such as the 1899 Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act displaced the Ainu from their traditional lands to the mountainous barren area in the island’s centre.

“It’s a very ugly story,” said Professor Kunihiko Yoshida, law professor at Hokkaido University.

Forced into agriculture, they were no longer able to fish for salmon in their rivers and hunt deer on their land, Yoshida said. They were required to adopt Japanese names, speak the Japanese language and were slowly stripped of their culture and traditions, including their beloved bear ceremony. Due to the wide stigmatisation, many Ainu hid their ancestry. And the long-term effects are clear to see today, with much of the Ainu population remaining poor and politically disenfranchised, with much of their ancestral knowledge lost.

Among other nefarious practices, Japanese researchers ransacked Ainu graves from the late 19th Century to the 1960s, amassing huge collections of Ainu remains for their study and never returning the bones.

Recently, however, things have started to look up for the Ainu. In April 2019, they were legally recognised as an indigenous people of Japan by the Japanese government, after many years of deliberation, which has resulted in a more positive appreciation of Ainu culture and renewed pride in their language and heritage.

""It is important to protect the honour and dignity of the Ainu people and to hand those down to the next generation to realise a vibrant society with diverse values,"" said government spokesman Yoshihide Suga, as reported in The Straits Times.

Naraki continued showing us around the Ainu kotan (village). Still smiling, she pointed to a wooden, cupboard-like structure. “This is the toilet for the men,” she said, giggling. Next to it was a smaller, teepee-style hut. “And this one is for the women.”

I want to tell the world that Japan has indigenous people

Naraki leads tours of this kotan to teach visitors about her culture. It is part of the Sapporo Pirka Kotan (Ainu Culture Promotion Centre), Japan’s first municipal facility featuring indigenous people, where visitors can experience Ainu handicrafts, watch traditional dancing and imagine traditional Ainu life when this area was a vast wilderness and the people lived on and with the land. Located approximately 40 minutes by car from downtown Sapporo, Hokkaido’s capital city, the centre was opened in 2003 to teach both other Japanese and foreign visitors about Ainu culture and spread their message to the world.

“97% of Ainu are underground. But the people who come here to events are very proud of their culture,” said Jeffry Gayman, an educational anthropologist at Hokkaido University who has been working with the Ainu for 15 years.

The pride is especially evident in the centre’s small, well-kept museum, where Ainu artefacts, such as traditional clothing and tools, are carefully displayed. Upstairs are rooms where visitors can join workshops on Ainu embroidery or learn how to make the traditional Ainu musical instrument mukkuri (a bamboo mouth harp). By hosting events, members of the community are able to educate the wider world on their history and situation.

“If I try to tell people about Ainu rights and empowerment, no-one is interested. But when people see our dancing or music, it makes them interested in learning more about us,” explained Ryoko Tahara, an Ainu activist and president of the Ainu Women’s Association.

Although this centre is a significant step in sharing Ainu culture nationally and internationally, no-one lives here. The kotan is a replica to show people what traditional Ainu life was like. Only a few isolated neighbourhood pockets of Ainu people remain, scattered across Hokkaido, with most of the estimated 20,000 Ainu (there are no official figures) assimilated into cities and towns around the island.

However, travellers who look carefully will be able to see traces of their culture everywhere. Many place names in Hokkaido have Ainu origins, such as “Sapporo”, which comes from the Ainu words sat (dry), poro (large) and pet (river) due to its location around the Toyohira River; or “Shiretoko” – a peninsula that sticks out from Hokkaido’s north-eastern tip – which can be translated as “of the ground” (siri) and “protruding point” (etuk).

And Ainu pride is visible at events like the annual Marimo Festival at Lake Akan and the Shakushain festival in Shizunai; and in groups like The Ainu Art Project, a 40-member group that share Ainu culture through their Ainu and rock fusion band and handmade arts and crafts. Restaurants such as Kerapirka in Sapporo serve up traditional Ainu food and act as a hub for the local community.

“And you can see Ainu values in any settings where Ainu people gather, whether that be inside their home, at a local town gathering or an event. But you need to know what you’re looking for,” said Gayman, explaining that “generosity and hospitality” are core Ainu principles. “They’re light-hearted people,” he said.

The Ainu have also become more prominent on the national stage, with activist Kayano Shigeru elected to the Japanese parliament in 1994, where he served five terms; and the hugely popular manga series, Golden Kamuy, pushing Ainu culture into the national spotlight over the last couple of years.

“In the last few years, people have become more interested in the Ainu; it has become a hot topic in Japan,” said Tahara. “That makes me proud that people will know about the Ainu, but there is still work to be done.”

The latest step forward for this community is the Symbolic Space for Ethnic Harmony in Shiraoi, Hokkaido, a new complex currently under construction by the government to showcase Ainu culture. Made up of a National Ainu Museum, the National Park for Ethnic Harmony and a memorial facility, it was scheduled to open in April 2020 in time for the Olympics, but has been delayed due to Covid-19.

The recognition is very symbolic, but not so meaningful

However, many experts believe that the recent recognition of the community is not enough, saying it is merely lip-service by the government, with the new Ainu bill failing to provide Japan’s indigenous people with clear and strong rights.

“The Ainu still cannot fish their salmon and dams are still being built that submerge sacred sites,” said Yoshida. “There’s no self-determination, no collective rights and no reparations. It’s just a cultural performance.”

“The recognition is very symbolic, but not so meaningful,” he added with a sad laugh, noting that Japan is far behind the world standard in treatment of indigenous people. “It’s a shameful situation. That’s the reality.”

As I followed Naraki on her tour of the kotan, it seemed clear, however, that public interest in Ainu culture is strong. Groups of Japanese people and other visitors, who’d arrived by bus-load from Sapporo, jostled for pictures in front of the pu, the hut for storing food, which is located directly opposite the poro-ci-set, where the village chiefs lived in order to keep a stern eye on the village’s communal larder. “The elders would resolve any disputes in the village,” Naraki said. If no one could agree, they would discuss for three days and three nights and then make a decision.

She explained how the Ainu’s lives were tied to the land. Kotans would be constructed along rivers or by the sea where water was plentiful and safe from natural disasters. Food was foraged or hunted, with staple proteins including salmon, deer and bear. They would pick wild grasses, vegetables, mushrooms and berries, such as kitopiro (Alpine leek) and shikerepe (berries of the Amur cork tree), never picking everything at once and always leaving the roots so the plants could keep growing. Food was simple, with animal oil, kelp and salt the only flavourings, and millet their main grain. Clothes were made with animal or fish skin, or woven with tree bark or nettle fibres.

Living in harmony with nature is a way of life that many Ainu would like to return to. “Eventually what I want is to get back some land so we can hunt and fish freely as well as do our traditional farming,” Tahara told me. Increasing numbers of Ainu are also starting to relearn their language, which is linguistically isolated and declared as critically endangered by Unesco.

What are your other hopes for the future, I asked Tahara.

“I want to tell the world that Japan has indigenous people. People don’t know,” she said. “I want us all to respect each other, to treat each other respectfully and live peacefully in this country. And, of course, I would like our ancestors’ bones returned. Bring them back to the graves they were taken from.”

Two-year-old Emile Ouamouno had been fond of playing inside the tree, which was near his home in Meliandou – a village in the heart of the Guinean jungle. But other life had also discovered its cosy confines: bats. Children would sometimes catch them there, before roasting them for dinner.

Then Emile got sick. On the 28 December 2013, he succumbed to a violent and mysterious illness. His mother, sister and grandmother were next. And that was it – after the funeral, the disease gradually began to spread.

By 23 March 2014, there had been 49 cases and 29 deaths – and scientists confirmed that it was Ebola. Over the next three and a half years, the world looked on in horror as the virus claimed more than 11,325 lives. But while this was going on, another tragedy was unfolding.

He first came to Taiwan in 2013 for a research trip as part of his environment masters programme. “When I arrived, the most obvious thing to me was that not only were there no litter bins, there was no litter either.”

The situation was vastly different 20 years before, after accelerated economic progress saw Taiwan lauded as one of Asia’s economic tigers, along with Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. But the price of economic success was high. Archive news reports say that in 1979, local governments were gathering up 8,800 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste a day. By 1990, that number had hit 18,800 tonnes. In 1992, it was still climbing, at 21,900 tonnes. Taiwan had acquired the unpleasant nickname of “garbage island”.

286,The Auschwitz doctor who couldn't 'do no harm',https://bbc.com/future/article/20200526-dr-gisella-perl-the-auschwitz-doctor-who-saved-lives,['Rachel E Gross'],"Perl thus performed her nightly abortions at great risk to her own life. “She didn’t make these choices from some point of security or superiority,” says Horowitz. “At the same time as she was a doctor she was a prisoner in a concentration camp… She too was a target of genocide.”

In her essay “Personal Responsibility Under a Dictatorship”, Hannah Arendt writes of “a germ-proof moralism… of being unwilling to dirty their hands.” In assisting Mengele, Perl didn’t have the luxury of keeping her hands clean. Every baby she delivered, every pregnancy she interrupted, she did with hands literally caked in mud and dirt. Mengele, by contrast, kept his fingers carefully encased in gloves. Once, Perl saw him beat a female prisoner’s face beyond recognition, then enter the hospital and take a bar of soap out of his bag to wash his hands.

Mengele saw himself as a learned man of science, a doctor fighting valiantly for the health of his “race”. But it was Perl who displayed a true devotion to the values of her profession. Though she could not follow the Hippocratic edict to “do no harm”, she did everything within her power to limit the growing harm around her. “A doctor’s life is worth living,” she would conclude in her memoir, “under any circumstances.”

L'Chaim: To Life

By March 1945, Perl had been moved from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen in northern Germany, where she would witness the liberation of the camps. She remained there for several months afterward, working in the hospital to deliver dozens more free babies. Finally, she left to wander Germany on foot for 19 days in search of her family.

To her horror, she learned that her husband had been beaten to death shortly before liberation, while her son had been cremated. For the first time, she no longer wanted to live and attempted suicide by poison.

After recovering, Perl did not immediately return to medicine. Instead she began travelling the world to speak of what she had witnessed and raise money for refugees. The turning point, she later recalled, was a chance encounter with then-First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who heard Perl’s story and invited her to lunch. Perl demurred, saying she was kosher. But Roosevelt insisted and organised a kosher lunch, where she urged Perl to return to her practice. “I didn’t want to be a doctor; I just wanted to be a witness,” Perl told the New York Times.

She would be both. In 1948 she published her memoir, the first to attest to the reproductive and sexual horrors inflicted on women prisoners.

She also wrote to the US War Department to offer herself up as a witness at any trial of Mengele, calling him “this most perverse mass murderer of the 20th Century” and testifying that “under his direction, [Auschwitz] became a perfectly organised death camp”. (Such a trial never occurred, as Mengele lived out his days as a fugitive in South America until he died in a swimming accident in 1979.)

That same year, President Harry Truman signed a special bill granting Perl permanent citizenship in the US. Democratic Representative Sol Bloom of New York – at Roosevelt’s urging – had introduced a version of the bill two years earlier.","Once, Perl saw him beat a female prisoner’s face beyond recognition, then enter the hospital and take a bar of soap out of his bag to wash his hands.

Across the city, swathes of eminent men were succumbing to sickness, and practically all of them were dying. The losses were as baffling as they were alarming.

Then one day, a slave approached a curule aedile – a kind of magistrate – and hinted that she might know why. The girl led a team of investigators to various houses, where she claimed they would find an alliance of upper-class women secretly preparing poisons. They did.

The accused were dragged to the central square, and asked to prove their innocence. Since they claimed their concoctions were medicinal, would they drink them?

Alas, two of the suspects obliged – and promptly dropped dead. Mass arrests followed, and a further 170 women were found to be involved. The incident was a huge scandal. In the aftermath, the people of Rome elected a dedicated official to perform a ritual banishment of evil, a tactic which had previously only been used as a last resort after extreme civil unrest.

Or, at least, this is the version of events that was dutifully recorded by the respected historian Livy, who was born a few hundred years later. But he wasn’t convinced that the women were really responsible, and neither are modern-day experts. Instead, Livy pointed to a far more rational explanation: an epidemic.

At the time, the city was in the grip of an unknown plague – a common cause of death in the classical world. Mass poisonings, on the other hand, were unheard of. The case discussed by Livy was the first of its kind, and the whole affair had struck Roman citizens as distinctly odd.

In fact, the women probably really were preparing medicines – and the rest of the story was heavily embellished or entirely made up. The infamous poisonings of 331 BC are thought to be a conspiracy theory, to explain deaths that had an obvious cause all along.

Amid the current pandemic, this scenario is oddly familiar. Since the beginning of April, at least 77 phone masts and 40 engineers have been attacked in the UK, after some people bought into the erroneous idea that Covid-19 is somehow being spread by powerful forces in the global telecommunications industry.

That’s not what many of us expected when we were first told that our lives were about to become so much more restricted than usual, with weeks of potential boredom, confined within our homes stretching ahead of us.

It’s too early for research on this of course, but anecdotally some people are puzzled to find that their days have slipped past surprisingly quickly. It seems hard to believe that we are already nearing the end of May, some two months after lockdowns began.

In the UK, people have been standing on their doorsteps every Thursday evening during the Covid-19 outbreak to applaud health workers. To me it feels as though the ritual is coming around more frequently, which is nice in one way because it is an opportunity to say hello to the neighbours, but disconcerting nonetheless because the weeks feels as though they are flashing by. Journalists from the US to Poland have also been contacting me to ask why time seems to have sped up during the crisis, so it seems I’m not alone.

One reason is that we create our own subjective experience of time in our minds and it doesn’t always match up with what we read on the clock or the calendar. A 20-minute lunch with a friend goes by in a flash, while a 20-minute wait for a delayed train can feel interminable, yet in reality of course the duration is identical.

Some people have found they haven’t even been distinguishing between weekdays and weekends. (Read more about how lockdown has redefined our weekends.)

This blurring of identical days leads us to create fewer new memories, which is crucial to our sense of time perception. Memories are one of the ways that we judge how much time has passed.

293,How staying indoors affects your immune system,https://bbc.com/future/article/20200521-can-staying-inside-weaken-the-immune-system,['Linda Geddes'],"For the past two months, a sizable chunk of the world’s population has been shuttered inside their homes, only stepping out for essential supplies. Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.

Humans evolved on a planet with a 24-hour cycle of light and dark, and our bodies are set up to work in partnership with sunlight. One of the most obvious examples of this is the production of vitamin D in the skin in response to UVB exposure. This daily dose of vitamin D can help to strengthen our bones and teeth, but it also has an effect on our immune cells.

Vitamin D enables the macrophages in our lungs – a first line of defence against respiratory infections – to spew out an antimicrobial peptide called cathelicidin, killing bacteria and viruses directly. It also tweaks the activity of other immune cells, such as B and T cells, which orchestrate longer-term responses. People with low levels of vitamin D are at greater risk of viral respiratory tract infections such as influenza.

Researchers are now investigating whether vitamin D supplements could even reduce the risk of some of the severe complications associated with Covid-19. Earlier this month, Rose Kenny, a gerontologist at Trinity College Dublin, and her colleagues published data suggesting that European populations with the highest death rates from Covid-19, including Spain and Italy, have the lowest levels of vitamin D. This may sound counterintuitive, given their sunny climates, but it is thought that changes in lifestyle have led people to spend more time indoors, which combined with greater use of sunscreen in these countries, may be responsible for the lower levels of vitamin D.","Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.

President Donald Trump has announced that he will start to end preferential treatment for Hong Kong in trade and travel, in response to a new security law pushed by Beijing.

He described the Chinese government's moves to introduce the measure in Hong Kong as a ""tragedy"".

Mr Trump also said he was ""terminating"" the US relationship with the World Health Organization over Covid-19.

China has told the West to ""stop interfering"" in Hong Kong.

The territory, a former British colony, enjoys unique freedoms not seen in mainland China. But many people there see the looming security law as bringing an end to Hong Kong's special status, agreed under a 1984 agreement between China and the UK.

There are fears the proposed measure - which has sparked a wave of anti-mainland protests - could end Hong Kong's unique status and make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory.

This week, Britain said that if China went forward with the law, it could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to UK citizenship.

On Friday, the UK Home Office confirmed that up to three million people with BNO status could acquire citizenship in this way - as long as they applied for and were granted a passport.

What did President Trump outline?

Mr Trump said that he no longer considered Hong Kong to be separate from China.

""China has replaced One Country, Two Systems with One Country, One System"", Mr Trump told reporters in the White House's Rose Garden, in a prepared statement that attacked China on several fronts.

""This is a tragedy for Hong Kong... China has smothered Hong Kong's freedom,"" he said.

Mr Trump said sanctions would be imposed on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who were believed by Washington to be involved in eroding the territory's autonomy. He did not outline what form these sanctions would take.

He added that the State Department would revise its travel advisory for Hong Kong in light of ""increased danger of surveillance"" from China.

The president also said the US would suspend the entry of foreign nationals from China identified by the US as potential security risks. There are fears that this could affect thousands of graduate students.

No further details were given on Mr Trump's announcement that he would ""terminate"" the US relationship with the WHO. In April, the US president said he would halt funding to the UN agency because it has ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak.

He accused the WHO of mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China.

The Global Times newspaper - whose views are believed to reflect those of China's leaders- called the move towards revoking Hong Kong's special status with the US ""recklessly arbitrary"".

Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng told the BBC's Chinese Service earlier on Friday that any threat of sanctions was unacceptable.

""Are the sanctions being imposed with a view to coerce another state to change their policy...? Any such sanctions are not going to benefit anyone,"" she said.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hong Kongers give their reaction to the controversial national security law being planned

Adding a new edge to the deteriorating US-China relations

Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese

The US removing Hong Kong's special privileges sent a strong warning signal to China, which activists and protesters in the territory will welcome.

The announced measures include not only Hong Kong, but also intellectual property theft and Chinese firms listed in the US.

According to media reports, Washington is expected to revoke more than 3,000 Chinese graduate students' visas. While this accounts for only 1% of the total number of Chinese students in America, Washington's move will open yet another front of the bilateral tensions.

But the separate punishments announced for China may not be as harsh as what had been expected, as indicated in the stock markets' rise after his speech.

Beijing will probably match some of Washington's sanctions and restrictions in a tit-for-tat manner. After a short-lived honeymoon since the trade deal, China and the US appear to be heading towards the abyss at an accelerating speed.

What is the security law about?

China has proposed security legislation which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong, and could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time.

China's parliament has backed the resolution - which now passes to the country's senior leadership.

Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September.

Image copyright AFP Image caption President Xi Jinping and other senior figures applauded when the security law was passed

However, it is expected to criminalise:

secession - breaking away from China

subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government

terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people

activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong

Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform.

He accused the WHO of mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China.

The Global Times newspaper - whose views are believed to reflect those of China's leaders- called the move towards revoking Hong Kong's special status with the US ""recklessly arbitrary"".

Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng told the BBC's Chinese Service earlier on Friday that any threat of sanctions was unacceptable.

""Are the sanctions being imposed with a view to coerce another state to change their policy...? Any such sanctions are not going to benefit anyone,"" she said.

Adding a new edge to the deteriorating US-China relations

Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese

The US removing Hong Kong's special privileges sent a strong warning signal to China, which activists and protesters in the territory will welcome.

The announced measures include not only Hong Kong, but also intellectual property theft and Chinese firms listed in the US.

According to media reports, Washington is expected to revoke more than 3,000 Chinese graduate students' visas. While this accounts for only 1% of the total number of Chinese students in America, Washington's move will open yet another front of the bilateral tensions.

But the separate punishments announced for China may not be as harsh as what had been expected, as indicated in the stock markets' rise after his speech.

Beijing will probably match some of Washington's sanctions and restrictions in a tit-for-tat manner. After a short-lived honeymoon since the trade deal, China and the US appear to be heading towards the abyss at an accelerating speed.

What is the security law about?

China has proposed security legislation which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong, and could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time.

China's parliament has backed the resolution - which now passes to the country's senior leadership.

Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September.

However, it is expected to criminalise:

secession - breaking away from China

subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government

terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people

activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong

Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform.

China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless"".","But many people there see the looming security law as bringing an end to Hong Kong's special status, agreed under a 1984 agreement between China and the UK.
Mr Trump said that he no longer considered Hong Kong to be separate from China.
""This is a tragedy for Hong Kong... China has smothered Hong Kong's freedom,"" he said.

68,Hong Kong security law: What is it and is it worrying?,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838,[],"Image copyright ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP

China stunned Hong Kong when it announced it would impose a national security law on the city. Many worry this could spell the end of Hong Kong's unique freedoms. So what do we know, and what do people fear the most?

What is this law all about?

First of all, nothing is set in stone... yet.

China initially submitted a draft resolution to its rubber stamp parliament, which was voted on and passed this week. Only now will it be fleshed out into an actual draft law.

So the details are thin but we know this much. A law would make criminal any act of:

secession - breaking away from the country

subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government

terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people

activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong

One part that has got people worried is the suggestion that China could set up its own institutions in Hong Kong responsible for security.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The identity crisis behind Hong Kong's protests

So it could introduce its own law enforcement agencies, alongside the city's own.

Why did China do this?

Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle.

They are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has.

Under the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact is own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law.

But its unpopularity means it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests.

Image copyright ISAAC LAWRENCE/AFP

Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement.

China doesn't want to see that happen again.

Why are people in Hong Kong afraid?

As the law has not even been drafted yet, it is hard to be concrete, but essentially people in Hong Kong fear the loss of these freedoms.

China expert Willy Lam is concerned the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China.

People believe this will affect free speech and their right to protest. In China, this would be seen as subversion.

Some pro-democracy activists - such as Joshua Wong - have been lobbying foreign governments to help their cause. Such campaigning could be a crime in the future.

Many are also afraid Hong Kong's judicial system will become like China's.

""Almost all trials involving national security are conducted behind closed doors. It [is] never clear what exactly the allegations and the evidence are, and the term national security is so vague that it could cover almost anything,"" Professor Johannes Chan, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong, says.

Finally, people worry that a threat to Hong Kong's liberties could affect its attractiveness as a business and economic powerhouse.

So can China just push this through?

The Basic Law says Chinese laws can't be applied in Hong Kong unless they are listed in a section called Annex III - there are already a few listed there, mostly uncontroversial and around foreign policy.

These laws can be introduced by decree - which means they bypass the city's parliament and Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam has already said she will co-operate.

Critics say this amounts to a breach of that ""one country, two systems"" principle, which is so important to Hong Kong.

If there were sanctions associated with any national laws to be included in the annex, Professor Chan also says it should go through Hong Kong's parliament because the judicial systems are so different.

""The values underlying the criminal justice system in two jurisdictions are so different that any criminal law should only be enacted by HK and not by the mainland,"" he says.

What's more, the draft resolution in itself goes against Article 23, says Professor Chan - because that says Hong Kong must draft its own security law.

So that suggests the Hong Kong government still needs to do that - which could make things complicated.

Hong Kong residents have shared their feelings about a new national law, planned by China's ruling Communist Party.

China is seeking to pass a law that would ban ""treason, secession, sedition and subversion"" in Hong Kong.

The law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress, which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year.

Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce such a law after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997. But its unpopularity means it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after 500,000 people took to the streets.

Now, after a wave of sustained protests in Hong Kong last year, Beijing is attempting to push the law through.

Critics say the law would strip Hong Kong of the rights it currently enjoys, that are not seen in mainland China.

Hong Kong has seen several months of pro-democracy protests - and China appears to be tightening its grip.

The protests began in June 2019 over plans - later put on ice, and finally withdrawn in September - that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. They then spread to reflect wider demands for democratic reform, and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.

Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law, which critics believe could be used to crack down on rights and political activists.

This is not all happening in a vacuum. There's a lot of important context - some of it stretching back decades - that helps explain what is going on.

Hong Kong has a special status...

It's important to remember that Hong Kong is significantly different from other Chinese cities. To understand this, you need to look at its history.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests

It was a British colony for more than 150 years - part of it, Hong Kong island, was ceded to the UK after a war in 1842. Later, China also leased the rest of Hong Kong - the New Territories - to the British for 99 years.

It became a busy trading port, and its economy took off in the 1950s as it became a manufacturing hub.

The territory was also popular with migrants and dissidents fleeing instability, poverty or persecution in mainland China.

Then, in the early 1980s, as the deadline for the 99-year-lease approached, Britain and China began talks on the future of Hong Kong - with the communist government in China arguing that all of Hong Kong should be returned to Chinese rule.

The two sides signed a treaty in 1984 that would see Hong Kong return to China in 1997, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"".

This meant that while becoming part of one country with China, Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years.

As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press are protected.

For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, where the military opened fire on unarmed protesters in Beijing.

...but things are changing

Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms not seen in mainland China - but they are widely thought to be on the decline.

Rights groups have accused China of meddling in Hong Kong, citing examples such as legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators, and the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, and a tycoon - who all eventually re-emerged in custody in China.

There are also accusations that press and academic freedoms have been deteriorating. In March, China effectively expelled several US journalists - but also prohibited them from working in Hong Kong.

The public broadcaster RTHK has come under pressure from Hong Kong's government, first for broadcasting an interview with the World Health Organization about Taiwan, and then for targeting police in its satirical news show ""Headliner"".

The local examinations body also came under fire for a world history question about relations between Japan and China, with the government demanding the exam question be invalidated. The government said it was a professional, rather than political, decision, but many academics expressed concern.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Police use tear gas on protesters

Another sticking point has been democratic reform.

Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee - a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6% of eligible voters.

Not all the 70 members of the territory's lawmaking body, the Legislative Council, are directly chosen by Hong Kong's voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers.

Some elected members have even been disbarred after Beijing issued a controversial legal ruling that effectively disqualified them.

Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, says that ultimately both the leader, and the Legislative Council, should be elected in a more democratic way - but there's been disagreement over what this should look like.

The Chinese government said in 2014 it would allow voters to choose their leaders from a list approved by a pro-Beijing committee, but critics called this a ""sham democracy"" and it was voted down in Hong Kong's legislature.

In 28 years' time in 2047, the Basic Law expires - and what happens to Hong Kong's autonomy after that is unclear.

Most people in Hong Kong don't see themselves as Chinese

While most people in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese, and although Hong Kong is part of China, a majority of people there don't identify as Chinese.

Surveys from the University of Hong Kong show that most people identify themselves as ""Hong Kongers"" - only 11% would call themselves ""Chinese"" - and 71% of people say they do not feel proud about being Chinese citizens.

The difference is particularly pronounced amongst the young.

""The younger the respondents, the less likely they feel proud of becoming a national citizen of China, and also the more negative they are toward the Central Government's policies on Hong Kong,"" the university's public opinion programme says.

Hong Kongers have described legal, social and cultural differences - and the fact Hong Kong was a separate colony for 150 years - as reasons why they don't identify with their compatriots in mainland China.

There has also been a rise in anti-mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong in recent years, with people complaining about rude tourists disregarding local norms or driving up the cost of living.

Some young activists have even called for Hong Kong's independence from China, something that alarms the Beijing government.

Hong Kongers know how to protest

Image copyright AFP Image caption Demonstrations in 2014 went on for several weeks

There's a rich history of dissent in Hong Kong, stretching back further even than the past few years.

In 1966, demonstrations broke out after the Star Ferry Company decided to increase its fares. The protests escalated into riots, a full curfew was declared and hundreds of troops took to the streets.

Protests have continued since 1997, but now the biggest ones tend to be of a political nature - and bring demonstrators into conflict with mainland China's position.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Nick Beake inside the Legislative Council after protests in 2019

While Hong Kongers have a degree of autonomy, they have little liberty in the polls, meaning protests are one of the few ways they can make their opinions heard.

As a result, many see taking to the streets as their only way of forcing change.

And, in the past, some protests have been successful. In 2003, up to 500,000 people took to the streets to protest against a controversial security bill the Hong Kong government was trying to pass. The local government also backed down over ""patriotic education"" classes following rallies against the move.

However, the Chinese government has adopted a harder stance in recent years, particularly with any movements it views as a direct challenge to its own authority.

In 2014, demonstrators took to the streets peacefully for several weeks, demanding Hong Kongers be given the right to elect their own leader. But the so-called Umbrella movement eventually fizzled out with no concessions from Beijing.

How did the latest crisis escalate?

In June 2019, protesters took to the streets again, demonstrating against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. This time, clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The identity crisis behind Hong Kong's protests

The bill was halted, and later fully withdrawn, but demonstrations continued for months, with demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions.

In April this year, Hong Kong police arrested 15 of the city's most high-profile pro-democracy activists for taking part in unauthorised assemblies.

In May, Hong Kong's police watchdog said it found no significant wrongdoing on the police's part during the 2019 protests - in a report that was criticised by many rights groups and external experts.

The street protests have mostly died down during the coronavirus pandemic, although some small demonstrations, including singing protesters in shopping malls, have started again as restrictions are gradually eased.

Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law in Hong Kong, which could be similar to the one withdrawn in 2003. It says the legislation is ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"".

However, the new proposal is also controversial because it is expected to circumvent Hong Kong's own law-making processes - leading to accusations that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.","Rights groups have accused China of meddling in Hong Kong, citing examples such as legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators, and the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, and a tycoon - who all eventually re-emerged in custody in China.

Minnesota's governor said the tragedy of the death of George Floyd in police custody had morphed into ""something much different - wanton destruction"".

New York, Atlanta and other regions have seen violent unrest, while the White House was briefly locked down.

An ex-Minneapolis policeman has been charged with murder over the death.

Derek Chauvin, who is white, was shown in footage kneeling on 46-year-old Mr Floyd's neck on Monday. He and three other officers have since been sacked.

Mr Chauvin, 44, is due to appear in court in Minneapolis for the first time on Monday.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters run after riot police launch tear gas canisters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Friday

President Donald Trump has described the incident as ""a terrible, terrible thing"" and said he had spoken with Mr Floyd's family, whom he described as ""terrific people"".

The Floyd case has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans.

It follows the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and others, which have all occurred since the Black Lives Matter movement was sparked by the acquittal of neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in 2012.

What's the latest on the protests?

Minnesota remains the most volatile region, with curfews ordered for the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-Saint Paul from 20:00 to 06:00 on Friday and Saturday evening.

Protesters defied the curfew on Friday. Fires, many from burning cars, were visible in a number of areas with fire officials unable to reach some sites.

Television pictures also showed looting in Minneapolis, with police officers thin on the ground.

Only at about midnight (05:00 GMT) did police and National Guard troops move in in any numbers, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports.

State Governor Tim Walz, in an early morning press briefing, described the situation as ""chaotic, dangerous and unprecedented"".

He said the Guard deployment was the largest in state history but admitted ""there's simply more of them than us"". He said those on the streets ""don't give one damn"" about the stay-at-home order.

The Pentagon has put the military on alert for possible deployment in Minneapolis.

On Friday evening, crowds gathered near the White House in Washington waving photographs of Mr Floyd and chanting ""I can't breathe"" - invoking his last words and those of Eric Garner, a black man who died after being held in a police chokehold in New York in 2014.

The White House was then temporarily placed on lockdown, with the US Secret Service closing entrances and exits.

In Atlanta, a state of emergency was declared for some areas to protect people and property. Buildings were vandalised and a police vehicle was set alight as protesters gathered near the offices of news broadcaster CNN.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued a passionate plea, saying: ""This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. You are disgracing our city. You are disgracing the life of George Floyd.""

In Dallas, officers launched tear gas canisters after they were pelted with stones.

Protesters blocked roads in Los Angeles and also in Oakland, where windows were smashed and ""Kill Cops"" graffiti sprayed.

What are the legal moves so far?

Mr Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter over his role in Mr Floyd's death.

Mr Floyd's family and their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that this was ""welcome but overdue"".

The family said they wanted a more serious, first-degree murder charge as well as the arrest of the three other officers involved.

Hennepin County Prosecutor Mike Freeman said he ""anticipates charges"" for the other officers but would not offer more details.

Mr Freeman said his office ""charged this case as quickly as evidence has been presented to us"".

""This is by far the fastest that we've ever charged a police officer,"" he noted.

According to the criminal complaint, Mr Chauvin acted with ""a depraved mind, without regard for human life"".

How did George Floyd die?

The full report by the county medical examiner has not been released, but the complaint states that the post-mortem examination did not find evidence of ""traumatic asphyxia or strangulation"".

The medical examiner noted Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and the combination of these, ""potential intoxicants in his system"" and being restrained by the officers ""likely contributed to his death"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Demonstrations and protests have continued since Mr Floyd's death in police custody on Monday

The report says Mr Chauvin had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive.

Nearly two minutes before he removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance and pronounced dead around an hour later.

The Minnesota police handbook states that officers trained on how to compress a detainee's neck without applying direct pressure to the airway can use a knee under its use-of-force policy. This is regarded as a non-deadly-force option.

What has the president said?

At the White House on Friday, Mr Trump said he had asked the justice department to expedite an investigation it announced on Friday into whether any civil rights laws were violated in Mr Floyd's death.

The president also said ""looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters"".

Image copyright EPA Image caption People gather outside the White House chanting ""I can't breathe"" and ""Stop killing us""

Earlier, he described the rioters as ""thugs"" who were dishonouring Mr Floyd's memory.

Social media network Twitter accused Mr Trump of glorifying violence in a post that said: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts.""

What happened in the arrest?

Officers suspected Mr Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 note and were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic.

According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed.

Here are three things you need to know from the UK:

1. Scientific advisers to the government have warned of the risk of lifting lockdown in England.

Prof John Edmunds from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine said the levels of the coronavirus were still ""very high"" and it was a ""political decision"" to ease measures. And Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, warned that the virus was “spreading too fast to lift lockdown” and that the NHS test and trace system should be ""fully working"" first.

2. Some extremely vulnerable people have been told they have been removed from shielding lists via text message, without the knowledge of their GP.

Around 2.2 million people in the UK are shielding – but healthcare charities say the lack of a clear plan for their future is causing anxiety and potentially putting their health at risk. Some people have received text messages removing them from official lists with no explanation, while charities say others have been asked to shield for longer - until the end of June.

75,China-India border: Why tensions are rising between the neighbours,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-52852509,"['Anbarasan Ethirajan', 'Vikas Pandey', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Press Information Bureau Image caption The area has become a hotspot in part because of a road India has built

The armies of the world's two most populous nations are locked in a tense face-off high in the Himalayas, which has the potential to escalate as they seek to further their strategic goals.

Officials quoted by the Indian media say thousands of Chinese troops have forced their way into the Galwan valley in Ladakh, in the disputed Kashmir region.

Indian leaders and military strategists have clearly been left stunned.

The reports say that in early May, Chinese forces put up tents, dug trenches and moved heavy equipment several kilometres inside what had been regarded by India as its territory. The move came after India built a road several hundred kilometres long connecting to a high-altitude forward air base which it reactivated in 2008.

The message from China appears clear to observers in Delhi - this is not a routine incursion.

""The situation is serious. The Chinese have come into territory which they themselves accepted as part of India. It has completely changed the status quo,"" says Ajai Shukla, an Indian military expert who served as a colonel in the army.

China takes a different view, saying it's India which has changed facts on the ground.

Reports in the Indian media said soldiers from the two sides clashed on at least two occasions in Ladakh. Stand-offs are reported in at least three locations: the Galwan valley; Hot Springs; and Pangong lake to the south.

India and China share a border more than 3,440km (2,100 miles) long and have overlapping territorial claims. Their border patrols often bump into each other, resulting in occasional scuffles but both sides insist no bullet has been fired in four decades.

Their armies - two of the world's largest - come face to face at many points. The poorly demarcated Line of Actual Control (LAC) separates the two sides. Rivers, lakes and snowcaps mean the line separating soldiers can shift and they often come close to confrontation.

The current military tension is not limited to Ladakh. Soldiers from the two sides are also eyeball-to-eyeball in Naku La, on the border between China and the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim. Earlier this month they reportedly came to blows.

And there's a row over a new map put out by Nepal, too, which accuses India of encroaching on its territory by building a road connecting with China.

Why are tensions rising now?

There are several reasons - but competing strategic goals lie at the root, and both sides blame each other.

""The traditionally peaceful Galwan River has now become a hotspot because it is where the LAC is closest to the new road India has built along the Shyok River to Daulet Beg Oldi (DBO) - the most remote and vulnerable area along the LAC in Ladakh,"" Mr Shukla says.

India's decision to ramp up infrastructure seems to have infuriated Beijing.

Image copyright AFP Image caption There have been protests in Nepal against Indi's new road link

Chinese state-run media outlet Global Times said categorically: ""The Galwan Valley region is Chinese territory, and the local border control situation was very clear.""

""According to the Chinese military, India is the one which has forced its way into the Galwan valley. So, India is changing the status quo along the LAC - that has angered the Chinese,"" says Dr Long Xingchun, president of the Chengdu Institute of World Affairs (CIWA), a think tank.

Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia programme at the Wilson Center, another think tank, says this face-off is not routine. He adds China's ""massive deployment of soldiers is a show of strength"".

The road could boost Delhi's capability to move men and material rapidly in case of a conflict.

Differences have been growing in the past year over other areas of policy too.

When India controversially decided to end Jammu and Kashmir's limited autonomy in August last year, it also redrew the region's map.

The new federally-administered Ladakh included Aksai Chin, an area India claims but China controls.

Senior leaders of India's Hindu-nationalist BJP government have also been talking about recapturing Pakistan-administered Kashmir. A strategic road, the Karakoram highway, passes through this area that connects China with its long-term ally Pakistan. Beijing has invested about $60bn (£48bn) in Pakistan's infrastructure - the so-called China Pakistan Economic corridor (CPEC) - as part of its Belt and Road Initiative and the highway is key to transporting goods to and from the southern Pakistani port of Gwadar. The port gives China a foothold in the Arabian Sea.

In addition, China was unhappy when India initially banned all exports of medical and protective equipment to shore up its stocks soon after the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year.

How dangerous could this get?

""We routinely see both armies crossing the LAC - it's fairly common and such incidents are resolved at the local military level. But this time, the build-up is the largest we have ever seen,"" says former Indian diplomat P Stobdan, an expert in Ladakh and India-China affairs.

""The stand-off is happening at some strategic areas that are important for India. If Pangong lake is taken, Ladakh can't be defended. If the Chinese military is allowed to settle in the strategic valley of Shyok, then the Nubra valley and even Siachen can be reached.""

In what seems to be an intelligence failure, India seems to have been caught off guard again. According to Indian media accounts, the country's soldiers were outnumbered and surrounded when China swiftly diverted men and machines from a military exercise to the border region.

This triggered alarm in Delhi - and India has limited room for manoeuvre. It can either seek to persuade Beijing to withdraw its troops through dialogue or try to remove them by force. Neither is an easy option.

""China is the world's second-largest military power. Technologically it's superior to India. Infrastructure on the other side is very advanced. Financially, China can divert its resources to achieve its military goals, whereas the Indian economy has been struggling in recent years, and the coronavirus crisis has worsened the situation,"" says Ajai Shukla.

What next?

History holds difficult lessons for India. It suffered a humiliating defeat during the 1962 border conflict with China. India says China occupies 38,000km of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary issues.

China already controls the Aksai Chin area further east of Ladakh and this region, claimed by India, is strategically important for Beijing as it connect its Xinjiang province with western Tibet.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption India and China have a long history of border disputes

In 2017 India and China were engaged in a similar stand-off lasting more than two months in Doklam plateau, a tri-junction between India, China and Bhutan.

India objected to China building a road in a region claimed by Bhutan. The Chinese stood firm. Within six months, Indian media reported that Beijing had built a permanent all-weather military complex there.

This time, too, talks are seen as the only way forward - both countries have so much to lose in a military conflict.

""China has no intention to escalate tensions and I think India also doesn't want a conflict. But the situation depends on both sides. The Indian government should not be guided by the nationalistic media comments,"" says Dr Long Xingchun of the CIWA in Chengdu. ""Both countries have the ability to solve the dispute through high-level talks.""

Chinese media have given hardly any coverage to the border issue, which is being interpreted as a possible signal that a route to talks will be sought.

Pratyush Rao, associate director for South Asia at Control Risks consultancy, says both sides have ""a clear interest in prioritising their economic recovery"" and avoiding military escalation.

""It is important to recognise that both sides have a creditable record of maintaining relative peace and stability along their disputed border.""","It has completely changed the status quo,"" says Ajai Shukla, an Indian military expert who served as a colonel in the army.
Reports in the Indian media said soldiers from the two sides clashed on at least two occasions in Ladakh.

77,SpaceX launch: Nasa astronauts set for second try,https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-52855029,"['Jonathan Amos', 'Bbc Science Correspondent']","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bad weather conditions delayed Wednesday's launch attempt

Rocket company SpaceX will make a second attempt in the coming hours to get Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit.

Their flight to the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday was postponed because of poor weather at Florida's Kennedy Space Center.

Saturday's forecast is not brilliant. The meteorologists say conditions will probably be touch and go again.

The lift-off is scheduled for 15:22 EDT (19:22 GMT; 20:22 BST).

There's huge focus on Hurley's and Behnken's mission because it will mark the first time that the United States has been able to launch its astronauts to the ISS since the retirement of Nasa's space shuttles in 2011.

It will also be the first occasion that the US space agency has used a private company to transport one of its crews to orbit.

But people were wrong if they thought this attention added to the pressure to get the astronauts off the ground, said Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.

""We will launch when we are ready,"" he told reporters. ""I'll tell you, the President (Donald Trump) and the Vice President (Mike Pence) were proud of the Nasa team and the SpaceX team for making the right call for the right reasons (on Wednesday).""

For skywatchers in the UK, the Saturday flight is less favourable for catching sight of the capsule coming overhead. The first pass following lift-off comes when conditions are too light (just after 20:40 BST). The second pass, at around 22:15 BST, is better, but the vehicle will be very low on the horizon in the southwest.

Image copyright NASA Image caption Saturday will run through the same routines

The first launch attempt in the week was scrubbed just 16 minutes before the designated launch time. There had been much electrical activity in the air throughout the day, and controllers concluded it wouldn't be prudent to proceed with the flight.

At the moment of postponement, Hurley and Behnken were sitting in their Dragon capsule atop its Falcon rocket with the booster fuels being loaded below them.

The frustration was that the countdown was going so smoothly; engineers had seen no technical issues of concern. The vehicles were in perfect shape to begin their ascent.

Saturday will follow exactly the same routines. The astronauts will head out to the pad about three hours prior to 15:22 EDT. A SpaceX ""close out"" team will help them strap into their capsule seats, and then it will be a case of running through the pre-flight checks with controllers.

Image copyright NASA Image caption Wednesday's countdown was very smooth, with no technical issues of concern

Nasa astronaut Nicole Mann said her colleagues were unflustered by the potential for further delay.

""There are plenty of things in life you can't control, the weather being one of them,"" she said. ""You need just to remain flexible, not to waste any energy on those things you can't control. And then do what you need to do: prepare, and then when it's time for the next launch opportunity, you know you're ready to go.""

If the launch goes ahead, Hurley and Behnken have about a 19-hour flight to the ISS. They'll use that time to try out systems onboard the Dragon capsule, including having a go at manual flying. They'll also need to get some sleep after what will have been a long day.

The duo are expected to stay at the ISS for between one and four months before returning to Earth.

SpaceX, which is run by the tech billionaire Elon Musk, has a $2.6bn contract with Nasa to provide six crew flights to the space station. The first of these is scheduled for the end of August, assuming nothing untoward happens on Hurley's and Behnken's demonstration.

The Boeing company has a similar contract, but it is a year at least behind SpaceX in its development timeline.

Forbes magazine has struck reality TV star and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner from its list of billionaires, and accused her family of inflating the value of her cosmetics business.

Forbes said the family went to ""unusual lengths"" to present its youngest member as richer than she was.

In tweets, Jenner dismissed the article as ""inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol"".

""I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there,"" she wrote.

""I can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money I have,"" she added.

The move reverses the status Forbes conferred on Jenner in 2019, when it declared her a self-made billionaire.

The description sparked controversy, with critics scoffing at the ""self-made"" title and pointing to her upbringing as a Kardashian family reality TV star.

Forbes, which is known for its widely cited billionaire rankings, credited Jenner's status to the success of her cosmetics company, which she founded in 2015 and which includes Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin.

Jenner last year announced she was selling a 51% stake in the company to beauty giant Coty for $600m.

Forbes said the family's accountant had provided it with tax returns that suggested the firm had done more than $300m in sales in 2016 and that publicists claimed sales of $330m the following year.

But information shared by Coty, which is publicly traded, showed Jenner's firm is ""significantly smaller and less profitable than the family has spent years leading the cosmetics industry and media outlets, including Forbes, to believe"", Forbes said.

Coty's presentation to investors about the business suggested the firm did only $125m in sales in 2018.

""If Kylie Cosmetics did $125 million in sales in 2018, how could it have done $307 million in 2016 (as the company's supposed tax returns state) or $330 million in 2017?"" Forbes asked in the article.

Despite the magazine's downgrade, Jenner is hardly hurting.

Forbes said she pocketed $340m from the sale of her business. It now estimates her net worth at ""just under $900m"".

US President Donald Trump has announced that he is terminating the country's relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO).

The president has accused the WHO of failing to hold Beijing to account over the coronavirus pandemic.

""China has total control over the World Health Organization,"" the president said while announcing measures aimed at punishing Beijing.

Washington will redirect funds to other bodies, he said.

The US is the global health agency's largest single contributor, providing more than $400m (£324m; €360m) in 2019.

Mr Trump, who is campaigning for re-election this year and has been criticised for his own handling of the pandemic, has blamed China for trying to cover up the coronavirus outbreak.

More than 102,000 people in the US have lost their lives to Covid-19 - by far the biggest death toll in the world.

What did Trump say?

""We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and directing those funds"" to other global public health charities, Mr Trump said in the White House Rose Garden.

""The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,"" he said.

He added that China had ""instigated a global pandemic that has cost over 100,000 American lives"".

The president accused China of pressurising the WHO to ""mislead the world"" about the virus.

What's the background to this?

Mr Trump's criticism of the WHO's handling of the pandemic began last month when he threatened to permanently withdraw US funding, suggesting the UN health agency had ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response.

""It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organisation in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world,"" he wrote in a letter to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on 18 May.

He later labelled the WHO a ""puppet of China"".

85,Twitter hides Trump tweet for 'glorifying violence',https://bbc.com/news/technology-52846679,[],"Image copyright Getty Images

Twitter has hidden a tweet by President Donald Trump from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.

It did the same hours later when the official White House account tweeted a copy of the president's words.

Instead of being deleted, both tweets can be viewed by clicking on a prominent warning.

It says that ""Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.""

This is the latest twist in an escalating row between Twitter and the White House.

The US president finds himself in unexpected company alongside other world leaders whose tweets have been censored.

In February 2019, Twitter had a tweet by Iranian Leader Supreme Ayatollah Ali Khamenei removed after it appeared to threaten author Salman Rushdie.

Also last year, several accounts associated with Cuban President Raul Castro and members of his government were suspended, citing policy violations.

Mr Trump was tweeting about the US city of Minneapolis, which has seen consecutive nights of protests following the death of a black man in police custody.

Image copyright Twitter Image caption Users have to press the View button to be able to see the President's tweet

The president said he would ""send in the National Guard"", and followed that up with a warning that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""

That second tweet was hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"".

Twitter's policy of adding a warning to, rather than deleting, tweets that break its rules when it comes to major public figures was announced in mid-2019. But the social network has never used it on Mr Trump - nor deleted any of his tweets before.

""This is the bravest and riskiest thing I've ever seen Twitter - or any social media giant - do,"" said Carl Miller, from the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at UK-based think-tank Demos.

""This pours rocket fuel over the online-harm-versus-free-speech debate. Online content policy doesn't get more incendiary than this.""

The same post remains unaltered on Facebook, without any warning attached.

On Friday, the president sought to clear up the tweets by saying he was misunderstood.

""Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot,"" he tweeted.

Seven people were shot in Louisville, Kentucky, at a protest over the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot by three white police officers in March.

""I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means,"" he wrote.

For years Twitter resisted calls to treat Donald Trump like any other user and make him follow its rules.

Then, on Wednesday, it made a first small move, not removing a tweet but adding a fact-checking link.

The company then had two choices - hunker down and weather the storm or continue to take action in accordance with its stated rules. It has now chosen the latter course of action, calling the president out for glorifying violence.

Any other user would have had their tweet removed, and might have seen their account suspended.

It now looks as though there is no easy way out for either of the two adversaries - a huge battle over the limits of free speech and the rights of social media firms to moderate content is looming.

It is difficult to see either side now backing down. The White House is busy scouring Twitter to find examples of other world leaders who have glorified violence without any comeback. Meanwhile others are finding all sorts of old Trump tweets that appear to have broken the rules by, for instance, spreading misinformation about treatments for coronavirus.

Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, who had appeared very reluctant to apply anything but the most light-touch regulation, now finds himself faced with the unappealing prospect of cracking down on world leaders far and wide.

The move means that other users will not be able to like, reply to, or simply retweet Mr Trump's post, Twitter said. However, they would still be able to retweet it with a comment attached.

In a Twitter thread, the social network said: ""This tweet violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.""

The ""historical context"" is a reference to the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"", coined by Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in 1967, in reference to his aggressive policing policies in black neighbourhoods.

A later report submitted to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence found that his ""get tough"" policy, involving ""the frequent display of shotguns and dogs by Miami police in black neighbourhoods"" contributed to a state of agitation in the black community until the eruption of the 1968 Miami riot some eight months later.

Twitter said: ""We've taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.""

Hours after the warning was added, President Trump tweeted: ""Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party"" and alleged that the social network was targeting Republicans.

Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party.

He directly referenced the executive order he signed the previous evening, aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms.

Earlier this week, Twitter used its fact-checking function to attach warnings to the president's tweets for the first time. That led the president to threaten to ""shut down"" social networks over allegedly stifling free speech.

The executive order signed by Mr Trump has no immediate effect on the social networks, however - instead, it begins a lengthy process that may result in changes down the line.","Image copyright Getty ImagesTwitter has hidden a tweet by President Donald Trump from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.
That second tweet was hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"".
For years Twitter resisted calls to treat Donald Trump like any other user and make him follow its rules.
The White House is busy scouring Twitter to find examples of other world leaders who have glorified violence without any comeback.
Meanwhile others are finding all sorts of old Trump tweets that appear to have broken the rules by, for instance, spreading misinformation about treatments for coronavirus.","['glorifying', 'president', 'shot', 'social', 'tweets', 'twitter', 'rules', 'white', 'warning', 'violence', 'hides', 'trump']"

Scientific advisers to the government have warned of the risk of lifting lockdown in England, as the UK heads into the weekend before rules change.

Professor John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to ease measures; Sir Jeremy Farrar said the NHS test and trace system should be ""fully working"".

More than two people will be able to meet outside from Monday and in England schools will reopen to some pupils.

Police have urged people not to break social distancing rules this weekend.

The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government, has published details of its confidential meetings.

It includes minutes of 34 Sage sessions, going back to 22 January, and a series of scientific reports.

They show one Sage meeting on 23 April estimated there would be only 1,000 cases per day by mid-May.

Instead, estimates by the Office for National Statistics suggest there are currently 8,000 cases per day in England alone. Those figures do not include cases in care homes or hospitals.

Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine and a member of Sage, said the levels of the coronavirus were still ""very high"" and many scientists would rather the number of cases declined before measures were relaxed.

Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, said on Twitter that Covid-19 is ""spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England"" and NHS test and trace ""has to be fully working and infection rates have to be lower"".

Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Peter Horby, who sits on Sage and chairs its NERVTAG subcommittee, said the R number was still close to one and it was important we ""don't lose control"".

He said: ""Relaxing these measures does require the test, trace and isolate system to be in place and fully operational and to operating to a level where you are capturing most cases and tracing the contacts within 48 hours.""

He accepted that social distancing could not be semi-permanent but urged people not to forget hand washing and other measures when groups of up to six are allowed to meet outside from Monday.

""What I would say is that returning to a situation where we lost control again is far worse than another week or two of social measures,"" he said.

""And I don't think they need to continue much longer but we do need a lot of caution for the next two to three weeks whilst that test, trace and isolate is really up and fully tested.""

The Sage documents warned there would be ""little time"" to re-impose stricter lockdown measures if the infection rate started to creep up again.

The documents also showed only half of people isolate for seven days when they become sick.

The Sage papers also show the government was told in April it was ""likely"" the infection rate - the R-number - would go above one (the point at which the epidemic starts to grow again) if non-essential shops were reopened.

Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said it was a ""dangerous moment"" and said the easing of lockdown was ""premature"" as he called on the government to reveal the regional R number so that the public can judge the level of risk.

He told the Today programme: ""The time has come to empower the public with much more information about the level of risk in their own part of the country.

""And I think it's now imperative that the government publishes this regional R number on a regular basis so the public can judge what they should do in response to the level of risk they're facing.""

It comes as police forces in England have warned people to take care in busy areas and beauty spots and as a fine weekend of weather is forecast.

From Monday, all four UK nations are due to have guidelines in place allowing more than two people to meet outside.

Each of the UK's nations has a different approach - and timescale - to lifting lockdown. England is the only nation to reopen primary schools to selected year groups on Monday.

In Scotland, two separate households - up to a maximum of eight people - can meet outdoors and in Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors.

In Wales, any number of people from two different households will be able to meet each other outside from Monday, but beauty spots remain closed.

The warnings come as former prime minister Theresa May has written to her constituents saying Boris Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings did not ""follow the spirit"" of the lockdown guidance.

Mr Cummings drove more than 260 miles from London to County Durham with his wife who had coronavirus symptoms in March, at a time when the public was being told to ""stay home"".

He also made a 50-mile round-trip to Barnard Castle 15 days later - a journey which police said might have broken lockdown rules.

Norway and Denmark say they will open up tourism between their two countries from 15 June but will maintain restrictions for Swedes.

Sweden did not impose a lockdown, unlike its Nordic neighbours, and its Covid-19 death toll - above 4,000 - is by far the highest in Scandinavia.

Danish PM Mette Frederiksen said Denmark and Sweden were in different places regarding the pandemic.

Denmark is also opening up tourism with Germany and Iceland, within limits.

Tourists from those countries cannot stay the night in Copenhagen, which has the most coronavirus cases. Danes can travel to those two countries too, without having to go into quarantine on their return.

The announcement dashes the hopes of Danes hoping to travel to Southern Europe for their holidays and Denmark's foreign minister said they should avoid big cities and stick to the countryside.

At a joint video news conference, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said ""we can't open too suddenly, that would jeopardise everything we've accomplished"".

Danish-Swedish economic ties are very close, especially in the Oeresund region, where they are linked by a giant suspension bridge. Moreover, they are both in the EU, whereas Norway is not.

Sweden's 10 million population is also bigger than that of Denmark (5.8 million) or Norway (5.4 million).

Denmark still cautious

Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said ""we can start gently opening up journeys from Denmark to a small group of neighbouring countries where the infection with Covid-19 is considered to be best under control"".

He advised Danish tourists to avoid urban areas with 750,000 inhabitants or more.

""We will still advise against all unnecessary trips to the rest of the world until 31 August,"" he said.

Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde warned earlier this week that excluding Sweden from moves to open borders across the Nordic region would be a political decision and not justifiable on health grounds.

In comments reported by Swedish TV on Friday, she said Sweden had hoped for a common Nordic solution but it was impossible.

The three Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - were the first in the EU to create a ""travel bubble"" enabling free cross-border movement for their citizens during the coronavirus crisis.

101,Coronavirus: What attacks on Asians reveal about American identity,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52714804,"['Helier Cheung', 'Zhaoyin Feng', 'Boer Deng', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Getty Images

Attacks on East Asian people living in the US have shot up during the pandemic, revealing an uncomfortable truth about American identity.

Though she was not born in the US, nothing about Tracy Wen Liu's life in the country felt ""un-American"". Ms Liu went to football games, watched Sex and the City and volunteered at food banks.

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the 31-year-old didn't think anything of being East Asian and living in Austin, Texas. ""Honestly, I didn't really think I stood out a lot,"" she says.

That has changed. With the outbreak of the pandemic that has killed around 100,000 people in the US, being Asian in America can make you a target - and many, including Ms Liu, have felt it.

In her case, she says a Korean friend was pushed and yelled at by several people in a grocery store, and then asked to leave, simply because she was Asian and wore a mask.

In states including New York, California, and Texas, East Asians have been spat on, punched or kicked - and in one case even stabbed.

Whether they have been faced with outright violence, bullying or more insidious forms of social or political abuse, a spike in anti-Asian prejudice has left many Asians - which in the US refers to people of east or southeast Asian descent - wondering where they fit in American society.

""When I first came here five years ago, my goal was to adapt to American culture as soon as possible,"" says Ms Liu.

""Then the pandemic made me realise that because I am Asian, and because of how I look like or where I was born, I could never become one of them.""

After her friend's supermarket altercation, she decided to get her first gun.

""I hope the world never comes to a day when we have to use that,"" she says, adding: ""That would be a very, very bad situation, something I don't even want to imagine.""

Authorities in New York City and Los Angeles say that hate incidents against people of Asian descent have increased, while a reporting centre run by advocacy groups and San Francisco State University says it received over 1,700 reports of coronavirus-related discrimination from at least 45 US states since it launched in March.

Police in at least 13 states, including Texas, Washington, New Jersey, Minnesota and New Mexico, have also responded to reported hate incidents.

Critics say those at the very top have made things worse - both President Donald Trump, and Democratic hopeful Joe Biden have been accused of fuelling anti-Asian sentiment to varying degrees with language they've used while talking about China's role in the outbreak.

And for many Asian Americans, it can feel as though, in addition to being targeted, their identity as Americans is being attacked.

How serious is anti-Asian prejudice in the US?

Large numbers of Asian Americans, and Asians in the US - have described a sharp change in their experiences following the outbreak.

Kimberly Ha, 38, says she noticed the difference in February, after a stranger began shouting at her as she walked her dog in New York.

""He yelled: 'I'm not scared of radioactive Chinese people' and started pointing at me, shouting 'you people shouldn't be here, get out of this country, I'm not scared of this virus that you people brought over,'"" the Chinese Canadian, who has lived in New York for over 15 years, said.

In the weeks that followed, she also noticed that ""about one in 10"" people she encountered in public appeared angry when they saw her. ""I've never felt that level of hostility before,"" she says.

On the opposite side of the US in California, Madison Pfrimmer, 23, had heard about anti-Asian attacks, but ""didn't think it was as prevalent as everyone made it seem"".

Then, in April, she helped translate for an elderly Chinese couple in a supermarket in Los Angeles when they were confronted by an angry woman who swore at them at length, threw water at them and sprayed them.

""She yelled 'how dare you come to this store where my family shops, how dare you come and ruin my country. You are why my family is not able to make money,'"" Ms Pfrimmer, who is half-Chinese, recalls.

Image copyright Madison Pfrimmer Image caption Madison Pfrimmer reported the incident to the police

Ms Pfrimmer says she tried to reason with the woman, who berated her for translating for the couple and hurled water from a bottle at her, soaking her legs and feet.

The woman walked by them again when they were waiting for the cashier, spraying them with something that appeared to be air freshener or disinfectant - and then followed the elderly couple to their car, where she took photos of them while shouting ""it's your fault"", and directing expletives at ""China"", ""all those dirty people"" and ""communism"".

""I ran to the couple, told them in Mandarin to just get in their car, and loaded their groceries for them - I handed the man the eggs through his window,"" says Ms Pfrimmer. The woman followed her in her car - until Ms Pfrimmer purposefully drove near a police station.

Asian rights groups and San Francisco State University teamed up to start the STOP AAPI HATE database, which records reports of Covid-19 discrimination directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US. They received examples from 45 states, with California and New York making up the bulk of cases.

The incidents recorded fall on a broad spectrum. Verbal harassment is by far the most common, but shunning, physical assault, workplace discrimination, being barred from establishments, and vandalism also feature in the database - with women more likely to be targeted than men.

Image copyright Larissa Lim Image caption A poster for the Disney film Mulan was vandalised

Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University who has been running the database, says he found so many incidents of people ""being coughed or spat upon"" that he added it as an additional category.

That's what happened to Ted Nghiem, a Vietnamese American in Philadelphia. He says in March, a man swore at him, yelling ""get out of here, you caused coronavirus"" - but it didn't particularly bother him.

However, later that month a man spat at him as he walked past, which got him ""really down for a day or two"".

""I did inform the cops but I don't know if anything happened… luckily I didn't catch anything,"" says Mr Nghiem, 37.

The STOP AAPI HATE database is based on online self-reporting. A separate BBC analysis of interviews and US media reports found coverage of more than 100 alleged incidents since January that appeared to target Asians.

About 70% of those incidents had a clear link to the pandemic, and about 40% of cases were reported to police.

Some incidents reached the bar of hate crimes. New York City police say they have investigated 14 hate crimes related to Covid-19, involving 15 Asian victims. There have been at least nine physical attacks in the state.

In California, an elderly man was attacked with an iron bar, and a teenager was taken to hospital after being physically assaulted.

In Texas, an Asian family, including a two-year-old and six-year-old, were stabbed in a supermarket. An FBI report obtained by ABC news said that ""the suspect indicated that he stabbed the family because he thought the family was Chinese, and infecting people with the coronavirus"". The family was Southeast Asian.

Statistics on Anti-Asian incidents in the US:

One third of people surveyed said they had witnessed someone blaming Asian people for the pandemic

1,710 incidents reported to STOP AAPI HATE - 15% of those cases involved physical assault or being coughed on or spat at

More than 100 individual incidents reported in the media

133 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination recorded by the New York City Commission on Human Rights - compared to 11 in the same period last year. The commission has intervened in 91 cases.

14 Asian-bias hate crimes investigated by police in New York

More than 100 alleged hate incidents reported to civic groups and police departments in Los Angeles

Some Asians have also reported being refused service from hotel rooms, or Uber rides, as a result of their ethnicity.

Matt (not his real name), a Chinese American emergency room doctor in Connecticut, noticed that several patients asked to be admitted to hospital because they said an Asian person had coughed near them.

He experienced what appeared to be anti-Asian bias more personally, when he tried to treat a patient thought to have Covid-19.

""I had my protective equipment on, walked in and introduced myself. Once they heard my surname, they were like 'don't touch me, can I see someone else - can you just not come close to me'.""

Many other minorities face more ""overt types of discrimination which are worse"", Matt says - but he fears that incidents such as what he experienced would be demoralising for medical workers.

""This is a pretty stressful time - we're working a lot more, wearing very uncomfortable equipment all the time, and a lot of us are getting exposed to Covid-19.""

'If he looks Chinese, he gets attacked'

The virus originated from Wuhan, China, and much of President Trump's rhetoric has focused on what he calls the country's failings to contain the outbreak.

Earlier this year, he regularly referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" - a term that critics said did not distinguish between China, the Chinese government, and people of Chinese ethnicity.

He later called for Asian Americans to be protected, saying ""the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form"".

But that hasn't stopped Chinese Americans from being blamed - or other East Asians from being targeted.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Members of the Asian American Commission gather in Massachusetts to condemn racism

Prof Jeung says about 40% of the reports he received were from ethnic Chinese people - but a majority of cases were from people of other East Asian ethnicities.

""That's an example of racial profiling - that 'if he looks Chinese, he gets attacked'.""

Back in February - before cloth masks were recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Dahyung Oh, 23, remembers a woman staring at her in a hostile manner on a New York subway platform.

""She started approaching me, pointing at me and saying 'Why aren't you wearing a mask, you should be wearing a mask',"" the university student, from South Korea, says.

The woman did not wear a mask herself, and Ms Oh felt ""singled out, because there were literally 10-20 people around us who weren't wearing masks"".

""I felt really angry at the situation, as if I was singled out because I'm Asian, and a small sized woman that could be easier for someone to target.""

Image copyright Dahyung Oh Image caption Dahyung Oh says her case was relatively minor - but she has still started avoiding some parts of New York

That incident didn't end in violence - but Ms Oh was lucky. In two separate incidents in New York in March, Asian women were physically attacked for not wearing masks. Many others have been harassed while wearing masks.

Prof Jeung says face masks can be a lose-lose situation for Asians when it comes to discrimination, because ""if they wear a mask, they are suspected of being infected - and if they don't wear a mask, they're suspected of being infected but negligent"".

It's not just in the US either - there have been several high profile cases of physical attacks against East Asians in the UK and in Canada. Vancouver's police department has said that 20 anti-Asian hate crimes have been reported in 2020 so far.

Meanwhile, in China, there has been discrimination of African residents - with reports of people being forced into quarantine, and a McDonald's barring African people from entering.

Many say they have been singled out for multiple Covid-19 tests, or been evicted, following online rumours that two Nigerians who had tested positive for the virus escaped.

""I think it is very consistent with past times of crisis, where typically one group is scapegoated,"" says Carmelyn P. Malalis, head of the New York City Commission on Human Rights. She cites the HIV/Aids crisis and Ebola as past examples.

In the US, there has been ""underlying anti-Asian discrimination"" even before the pandemic, but little awareness of it, because there are typically lower levels of reporting, and ""people often think of racism as a black-white thing, not realising that racism exists in many forms,"" she adds.

Why are Asian Americans still seen as outsiders?

Asians in the US come from a wide range of ethnicities, countries and backgrounds, and often have different political beliefs and identities.

Some 20 million US residents - or about 6% of the US population - are Asian, according to census data. The figure includes Asian Americans, as well as people from South and East Asia living, studying or working in the US.

Image copyright Kimberly Ha Image caption Chinese Canadian Kimberly Ha (centre) was told to get out of the US

Some Asian residents, such as Bhutanese Americans, are more likely to be immigrants born abroad, while others, such as Japanese Americans, are most likely to come from families that have been in the US for generations.

About three million tourists from China alone visit the US each year.

But race-based prejudice against Asians in the US is indiscriminate, whether one identifies as Asian American, hopes to become American, or is simply visiting.

Asian Americans have described some common experiences - including that they've been seen as ""perpetual foreigners"" even before the pandemic.

""Race, like many social categories, [is a] thing that says you're part of this category [that is] plainly visible for everybody to see,"" says Debbie Ma, a psychology professor at California State University, Northridge.

""Because of that,"" she adds, ""it's very easy to quickly label and assign stereotypes and associations with those categories"" - that an East Asian person is foreign, even if they are not, for example.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Who's more American - Kate Winslet or Lucy Liu?

A 2008 study she co-authored found that respondents - US university participants of various racial backgrounds and ages - were more likely to implicitly think of Kate Winslet, the English actress, as ""American"", than Lucy Liu, the New York-born star of Chinese heritage.

Matt says he is regularly told ""you speak great English"", and asked where he is actually from, even when he explains he was born in the US.

Meanwhile, Prof Jeung says: ""Even though my family's been in the US for five generations, I'm still seen as a foreigner.""

Dr Ma notes that these are ""specific burdens"" that Asian people in America experience differently from other minorities. For example, ""nobody is surprised when a black American speaks English really well,"" though African Americans face other sets of prejudices, she says.

This has made a person's Asian appearance - something ""we wear so apparently"", as Dr Ma puts it - a reason to target them amid the outbreak.

Nor is it the first time race has been used as cover to marginalise or act against East Asians in the US.

Asian Americans were interned en masse in the US following attacks on Pearl Harbour in World War Two, and sweeping caricatures of East Asians were used as racist propaganda to exclude immigration from China and other eastern countries in the 19th Century.

Today, some Asian Americans still describe feeling ""on probation"", and needing to prove their status as US citizens - a situation that has significantly worsened amid the outbreak.

Andrew Yang, a former Democratic candidate for president, wrote in April in the Washington Post: ""Some level of background disdain or alienation has grown into outright hostility and even aggression.""

He called on Asian Americans to ""show our American-ness in ways we never have before"" by helping neighbours and wearing ""red white and blue"". However, he was also accused of victim-blaming for appearing to internalise the notion that Asian people, by virtue of their ethnicity, are not American enough.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Andrew Yang became one of the most high-profile Asian Americans when he ran to be the Democratic nominee

Both the Trump and Biden campaigns have also come in for criticism. An advert for the Trump campaign described Mr Biden as soft on China, and showed a montage of video clips of him with Chinese officials.

The montage included a shot of Gary Locke - the Chinese American former Washington governor who served as the US ambassador to China - leading to accusations that the ad was implying Mr Locke was a foreign official.

The Biden campaign came under fire after an attack ad emphasised that ""Trump let in 40,000 travellers from China into America"" after announcing a travel ban - even though many of those would have been American citizens.

Both campaigns have denied any xenophobia or targeting Chinese Americans.

How are Asian people in the US responding to attacks?

For some, the rise in anti-Asian sentiment has felt clear and dangerous.

There is no comprehensive data on race and gun purchases in the US, but reports from gun shop owners suggest that many have seen more Asian buyers amid a general rise in sales.

Chinese American Donghui Zang, 49, has started organising neighbourhood patrols in Queens, New York, where the group's more-than-200 members take turns driving around and reporting suspicious activities to the police. A dozen of members in the patrol group, including Mr Zang, have recently applied for firearms permits.

Mr Zang, who describes himself as socially conservative, believes Chinese Americans should arm themselves ""in case of social turmoil and skyrocketing crime"".

The view is not shared by everyone.

Max Leung, a co-founder of the San Francisco Peace Collective, says his group conducts patrols in Chinatown to help stop cases of vandalism and theft.

Image copyright San Francisco Peace Collective Image caption The San Francisco Peace Collective also tries to help vulnerable individuals who may have concerns about their safety

""Although I do believe and am a huge advocate of self-defence, we do not promote our members bearing arms while on patrol,"" Mr Leung, 49, says. ""The culture I want to create within our group is that of promoting peace, not perpetuating violence.""

Artists and comedians have also been inspired to speak out - including hip hop artist Jason Chu, who started the campaign Hate is a Virus, and wrote a rap about anti-Asian incidents.

He says the rap aimed to show ""the ridiculousness of people targeting Asian Americans"", and also ""emphasise the fact that Asian Americans belong here"".

""We're not guests in America - we were born here - this is where our parents raised us. We're saying that hate has no place in our country.""

More generally, there are hopes that this new awareness of discrimination will lead to stronger Asian communities in the US - and more solidarity with other ethnic minorities.

Matt recalls hearing negative comments about the African American community as he grew up - including from Asian Americans.

By contrast, ""now I see a lot of Asian Americans standing up for Ahmaud Arbery"", the black jogger shot dead in a Georgia suburb by two white men now charged with murder.

Matt believes that Asian American communities have become more vocal in recent years about politics and representation.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The film Crazy Rich Asians was seen as an important moment for Asian American representation

""A lot of my friends have seen this anti-Chinese rhetoric going on, and become more interested in talking about the discrimination that other communities face"" as a result.

Prof Jeung says he has seen examples of Asian Americans ""recognising their common interests, and mobilising as a political group and community"".

Asians from different walks of life now ""find themselves having a common experience"" due to discrimination related to the pandemic.

""We're all facing this process, of racial profiling, together. So hopefully, we'll come together to fight the racism, and develop empathy with other people who are racially profiled.""

102,Rohingya refugee crisis: 'The bodies were thrown out of the boat',https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-52832841,"['Swaminathan Natarajan', 'Moazzem Hossain', 'Bbc World Service']","Image caption Khadiza fled Myanmar after her husband and son were killed

""Nobody knows how many people have died. It could be 50 or even more,"" recalls Khadiza Begum.

The 50-year-old was among 396 Rohingya Muslims who had tried to reach Malaysia but who finally returned to the Bangladeshi shore after the boat carrying them was stranded at sea for two months.

Her estimate on the number of deaths comes from the funerals her son officiated as an imam, a Muslim preacher, on the same boat.

The human smugglers never delivered them to their longed-for destination.

Khadiza had to run away from her home in Myanmar because of violence that UN investigators described as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".

Neighbouring Bangladesh gave her shelter, settling the fleeing Rohingya Muslims in what has now become the world's largest refugee camp.

Around one million Rohingya are housed in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, and some among them, like Khadiza, hold dreams of a better life in Malaysia, lying across the Bay of Bengal.

Image caption The refugee boat was carrying people to Malaysia

But in Khadiza's case, the dream turned into a nightmare.

She recounts how the crew - the human traffickers - tried to conceal deaths on their crowded boat.

""They would run both engines so that none could hear the sound of splashing water when bodies were thrown out.""

Often, she says, the bodies were disposed of during the night: ""I know for sure at least 14 to 15 women died.""

The death of a woman who was sitting next to her continues to traumatise Khadiza. Severely dehydrated, the woman was initially disoriented and behaving strangely. The crew took her to the upper deck of the boat, where Khadiza says she died.

""I am still haunted by her death. She died in front of our eyes.""

The woman had four children with her. ""My son informed the eldest daughter, just 16 years old, that her mother had died.""

Image caption Khadiza's boat was adrift for two months

""The woman's three other children didn't know what happened to their mother."" she says. ""They were crying. It was heart-breaking.

""The body was immediately thrown out.""

Khadiza is a mother of four, too. She was made homeless and stateless in 2017 after her husband and one of her sons were killed during army operations in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.

Her village was torched, forcing her to go to Bangladesh to settle in the Cox's Bazar refugee camp with her children.

After marrying off her eldest daughter, she craved to provide a better life for her remaining son and daughter. ""We had a tough life. I didn't see any future for us in a refugee camp.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch: Who are the Rohingya?

Stories she heard about the Rohingya who crossed the sea to Malaysia for a better life fascinated her. Khadiza sold her jewels and put together $750 (£610) to pay to traffickers who would arrange a boat for them.

Then one night in February, she received the phone call she had been waiting for.

She kept her intentions secret and bundled some clothes and gold jewels in a small bag. ""I told my friends and neighbours that I would be going away for medical treatment,"" she tells the BBC.

With her son and daughter in tow, Khadiza locked their home and slipped away in darkness.

A man met them near a bus stand, guiding them to a farm house where she saw hundreds of others.

The group was taken to a boat that slowly set sail in the Bay of Bengal, between the Saint Martin's Island in Bangladesh and Sittwe in Myanmar.

""I had been planning for months. I wanted a better life. I was dreaming of a new life in a new country,"" she says.

Image caption Khadiza’s son officiated the funerals of those who died on board

After two days they were transferred into a another boat: a bigger one, full of people.

Khadiza says she didn't even have room to stretch her legs: ""There were families with women and children. I think there were more than 500 people.""

The boat was larger than a typical trawler used in South Asia, but certainly not big enough to carry so many people.

Crew members stayed on the upper deck, women were given the middle deck and men were pushed to the bottom. Ironically, the crew were Burmese men from Myanmar - the country from where the Rohingya were forced out.

""At the beginning I was scared,"" Khadiza remembers. ""I didn't know what our destiny would be, but as we settled in, I started dreaming again.

""I thought we would achieve a better life. So whatever troubles we were going through did not matter.""

The boat lacked basic facilities like water and sanitation. Khadiza washed herself only twice in two months by drawing water from the sea, in front of others.

Toilets consisted of two wooden planks with a hole in the middle.

""A few days after we started our journey to Malaysia, a boy fell through the hole into the sea,"" Khadiza remembers. ""He fell and died.""

It was the first of many deaths she witnessed.

Image caption Khadiza believes at least 50 people died during the journey

After sailing for seven days, sometimes in bad weather, the group finally spotted the Malaysian coast. Here, there were expecting smaller boats to transport them to the land.

But none arrived.

The coronavirus outbreak had tightened Malaysian security: with coast guards conducting more frequent patrols, making it difficult to sneak in the country.

The captain told the refugees they would not be able to land in Malaysia. Khadiza's hopes had been shattered by the pandemic.

The crew had to retreat, but faced a shortage of food and water.

On their way to Malaysia the refugees had been given rice twice a day, sometimes with lentils, and a mug of water.

""At first, it became one meal every day. Then one meal every two days - just plain rice with nothing else,"" Khadiza recalls.

The lack of drinking water was becoming unbearable.

Khadiza says that, in desperation, some of the refugees even drank seawater: ""People would try to quench their thirst by soaking clothes in water, then wringing it get the drops in their mouths.""

Days later, off the coast of Thailand, a small boat arranged by the human traffickers brought in much needed supplies.

But, while they were waiting for another chance to get to Malaysia, the Burmese navy intercepted them.

""They arrested the captain and three crew members, but they were released,"" Khadiza says. ""I guess they made some sort of a deal.""

Their second and last attempt to land in Malaysia was also to end in failure. It became clear to everyone on the boat that they were going nowhere.

""We were drifting around in the sea, with no hope of ever reaching the shore. People were getting desperate. We kept asking ourselves how long we could survive like this.""

So, a group of refugees went up to the crew and pleaded with them to disembark anywhere, regardless of whether it was Myanmar or Bangladesh.

But the crew refused, believing it too risky. They could be arrested and their boat taken away.

As the boat drifted aimlessly in Bay of Bengal, stories accusing the crew of rape and torture started circulating.

""Things were getting out of control,"" Khadiza says. ""I heard one of the crew members was attacked and killed - his body dumped in the sea.""

There were 10 Burmese crew members overseeing almost 400 refugees. ""They realised it would be very difficult for them to fight and win,"" she says.

The crew demanded more money to hire small boats which would take them ashore. Those on board coughed up another $1,200.

After a few days, a small boat approached them. Immediately, the captain and most of the crew members jumped in to run away.

Those remaining managed to steer the boat towards Bangladesh, with the help of two remaining crew members.

Image caption Khadiza Begum is now back in the refugee camp again, traumatised by her experience

""I was so happy when I finally saw the coast for the first time in two months."" Khadiza remembers.

They were back in Bangladesh again. After seeing the people in such a bad condition, local villagers informed the Bangladeshi Coast Guard.

After spending two weeks in quarantine, Khadiza returned to her refugee camp, only to find out that her place was now occupied by another family.

She has no hope of going back to Myanmar to live again on the land she farmed.

She now has to share a tiny space with her son and daughter.

""I lost everything for my dream,"" she says, in quiet contemplation. ""Never make the mistake I made.""

Imagine breaking free. You sell your possessions, buy a van, pack it with what you need, and go. For months or years you live a frugal life, going wherever you want. But for thousands who made this dream a reality, coronavirus brought them to a sudden halt, writes Paula Dear, and left them stranded with a van and a vanload of kit on the far side of the world.

For Radka and Ivar the plan began to form when they met in 2016. Both working as personal carers for a disabled man in Trondheim, central Norway, they would cross paths as she finished the night shift and he took over for the day.

Radka was the more experienced traveller. She had previously hitchhiked from Russia to south-east Asia and was preparing to do the same from Argentina to Alaska. But after falling in love with Ivar, who was in the process of retraining as a nurse, she faced a dilemma.

""There were lots of conversations. I said, 'You have to promise me that once you're done studying you'll go with me.' It was a deal-breaker, and Ivar adopted my dream very quickly!"" she says.

In the meantime, Radka took a six-week trip to Patagonia with a friend, and at one point hitched a lift with a woman called Silvia from Ushuaia in Argentina, the world's southernmost city. They stayed in touch, and three years later this would turn out to be a critical stroke of luck.

Radka and Ivar's plan slowly morphed from backpacking to travelling the Americas by van, and they picked up a second-hand Toyota Hiace. With help from Radka's dad, they built a basic bed and kitchen in the back, and storage for their gear - including climbing and freediving equipment, bicycles and an inflatable canoe.

""We needed a van because Ivar has a shedload of sports stuff,"" says Radka. ""But also it's the freedom of it. When we are inside the van, with gas for two months and food for several weeks, we can be totally off grid. We thought it would be great to have comfort and the ability to drive wherever we want.""

Ivar, who'd previously been a climbing instructor, studied hard for his nursing degree and they worked ""every single job that came our way"" to save money, says Radka, who would often finish a nightshift and go on to do cleaning jobs before having four hours off ahead of the next nightshift.

She developed terrible sleeping problems, she says: ""I burnt out and made myself ill. But I did it because I had a dream, and I wanted to make it come true.""

In the flurry of preparations, they were still making last-minute modifications to the van on the day they drove it to the port in Germany for its voyage across the Atlantic and through the Panama Canal to Chile.

Six weeks later, in early January they were in San Antonio to collect it and begin their epic journey. It was the height of summer and their plan was to loop down at a leisurely pace to the southern tip of Argentina - the symbolic start of their one-to-two year trip - and then drive north, all the way to Alaska.

So, stopping frequently, they slowly headed south, enjoying hikes in the Chilean island of Chiloé and Argentinian trekking hub of El Chaltén, and a trip to the 5km-wide Perito Moreno glacier. Camping out in nature soon started to smooth out Radka's erratic sleeping patterns.

El Chaltén was ""absolutely amazing"", says Radka, who had long fantasised about photographing the famous fiery reds and burnt oranges and yellows of the Patagonian autumn, which by this time was already beginning.

""But the weather forecast was bad, so we said, 'Let's go to Ushuaia and when we come back this way it's going to be even nicer colours,'"" Ivar says.

By this stage they were hearing reports of Covid lockdowns in Europe, but were reassured by friends in Argentina and Chile that similar moves seemed unlikely there.

""We were discussing whether we should go to Ushuaia or not, because it's locked in with a Chilean part above it. But there really wasn't any news, and when we asked people they said it was just recommended to wash your hands, no more. So we decided to go. And then it all happened really quickly and we couldn't get back out,"" says Ivar.

Image copyright Radka and Ivar

Hours after they arrived on 15 March, the borders unexpectedly closed, trapping them on the Argentinian side of Tierra del Fuego island, which can only be exited via a Chilean ferry.

With people being ordered to stay at home or in hotels they decided to drive out of the city and wait out the initial 14-day lockdown in their van. As camping was banned, they had to conceal their plans from the police when they encountered a checkpoint at the edge of Ushuaia. An hour north, at a forest lake called Laguna Margarita, they found a spot to wild-camp.

""We were afraid someone would see us and report us. But we were really deep in the woods, and nobody came,"" says Ivar.

When the weather allowed, they paddled on the lake or went running. Ivar taught Radka how to rope-climb in the trees. It was tough going at times, too. The wind and rain often forced them inside and there wasn't enough sun to replenish their solar-generated electricity. On day two they ran out of cooking gas, and they were washing in near-freezing water.

But they weren't too worried. Once the two-week confinement was over, they would return to El Chaltén and wait out the crisis - they could happily spend months hiking in the national park's mountains. The lack of gas, however, forced them to drive back towards Ushuaia, and when they picked up a phone signal again it became obvious the crisis was deepening. National parks had closed. They read increasingly desperate reports from fellow nomads on Facebook forums.

Moreover, they were ""really afraid"" they would get into trouble from the police for camping in the car during lockdown. ""We didn't know how to explain where we'd been for those two weeks, or where we were going,"" says Radka. She messaged Silvia, the woman who had given her a ride in 2016. Could she vouch for them or provide an address?

En route back to Ushuaia they hit a police checkpoint.

""They were filming us and the car, asking where we had been, where we were going. We tried to tell them we'd been camping but we don't speak good Spanish. I'm not sure they understood,"" says Ivar.

""We were so stressed we then took off in the wrong direction. When we turned back we were met by two police cars with sirens.""

The officers weren't pleased.

""They said they would escort us to our hostel in Ushuaia. They didn't realise we didn't have one.""

On the way Radka tried Silvia again, and luckily she responded. Within the half-hour drive she had secured them a friend's rental apartment, and they were escorted right to the door by the police.

Image copyright Radka and Ivar

Two weeks of lockdown in the apartment followed. It was much like those seen elsewhere, with trips to the supermarket or pharmacy allowed, and little else.

""For the first few days we felt OK, binge-watching TV series, enjoying hot showers. But we started to realise this was not going to be a situation for a couple of weeks, and that we really couldn't afford to pay for accommodation for up to six months, because even if they then opened the borders, we'd be out of money. We were quickly getting more and more tired and depressed, and I started having problems sleeping again,"" says Radka, tearfully.

""When you are at home, I imagine you find things to keep yourself busy - clean or paint or bake, whatever. But being in a foreign flat in a foreign country where you were not planning to stay, it's maybe different,"" says Radka. ""You can't focus on doing something new. You spend your day researching every desperate possibility to get out of there. We were even looking at whether it was possible to sail across the ocean! And when each one is a dead end it feels like such a waste of energy and motivation.""

Ivar adds: ""It's like waiting in a bus stop, when you don't know exactly when you're going to leave and it's not the place you want to be.""

But the decision to leave wasn't straightforward. It slowly crept up on them, says Ivar: ""It kind of evolved from possibly going home because it's going to be boring to wait, to realising if we stay three of four more months our well-being might suffer.""

When Radka received an SMS from the embassy to say there were repatriation flights from the capital, Buenos Aires, she felt an irresistible pull homewards.

""I felt a bit like a failure when I started to consider going back. We have friends who are staying. It was like we were giving up. But everybody's situation is different.""

Radka and Ivar are part of a sizeable community of people who travel and live in vehicles for months or years at a time - sometimes permanently - and are known as ""overlanders"" or ""vanlifers"". Some work as they go along, or stop for a while to volunteer, others have already retired. Ask them to #stayathome and, well, it can be a bit complicated. Where?

You might think that as they are equipped to live off-grid, they would be fine during lockdown. In reality, their lifestyle choice depends on the ability to move around, camp, and access services like water, power, gas and toilets. With regional and national borders closed, most campsites shut and wild camping banned, ""outsiders"" being discouraged in many areas, and bureaucratic headaches over visas and complicated vehicle permits, thousands of travellers around the world are either trapped or having to abandon their homes on wheels and return ""home"".

In some ways, Covid-19 has been like a game of musical chairs for overlanders, who have found themselves in varying situations depending on where they happened to be when the music stopped.

Around 10,000km north of Ushuaia, in the Colombian city of Medellín, Berliners Anne and Martin are living in their VW Westfalia camper in the driveway of a hostel, where they can use the toilets and showers. That wouldn't be allowed in many places under lockdown but they happened to be staying there while fixing some mechanical issues, when the crisis began. The owners allowed them to stay and they decided to sit it out in their van.

Image copyright Anne and Martin Image caption Anne and Martin when the going was good

""For us there was never a question of leaving the van behind,"" says Anne.

""We also didn't really see the point of returning back to Europe as the number of infected people was much higher than here. We don't have a home, as we moved out of our apartment and sold all our belongings. We could stay at our parents' places but, in our mid-30s, it's not really our goal.

""The days are getting really long and repetitive. We are safe and healthy, but we are stuck. We miss being on the road,"" she says.

Radka and Ivar missed it too, but they couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel. Luckily, the airport in Ushuaia re-opened and they booked a flight to Buenos Aires. The van and their gear would have to stay behind. But with strict rules in most countries, including Argentina, about how long a foreign-plated car can remain there, they had just one day to work out the logistics and find a place to park it. Again, through Silvia's network they managed to secure written permission from a resident who would allow the van to be parked at his house, and a letter from the customs authorities enabling them to leave it behind until the crisis is over.

""It was a stressful day. We really hope that everything is OK with the papers,"" says Ivar. ""It's incredible how it worked out, although when we parked the van and left it there I was nervous about handing the keys over because we had never met the guy. There's a part of us that's afraid we won't see the van again. Maybe we'll show up and they'll be like, 'What car?!'""

Image copyright Radka and Ivar Image caption Radka on the journey south, in Los Glaciares national park

After they arrived in Buenos Aires, their repatriation flight was refused permission to fly. Just before the next flight, a week later, they were told they hadn't made the list. For nearly three weeks the couple waited in a cheap hostel room in the city, feeling increasingly despondent. They started to question whether they really would get out. Finally, on 7 May, they boarded a Norwegian Air flight to Oslo, costing them €1,300.

Back in Norway, they had to complete 10 days of quarantine, but were lucky to have access to a rural family cabin, where they sat it out in peace.

""We have gone through all the emotions… but right now we're just really happy to be back in Norway,"" says Ivar.

""On a scale of one to 10, the disappointment is 11,"" says Radka.

""The longer we stayed and the worse I felt, I said 'OK I admit it, I can't imagine spending another four months like this, so I'm willing to spend some of our savings on going home to Norway where people have a bit more freedom.' I was going crazy.""

The self-confessed pessimist of the pair, she worries about whether they can gather the funds to return to Argentina and, if they do, whether tourists will still be welcomed under the ""new normal"".

""And I feel like we have lost time. If we start the trip again in, say, January, that was a time when we were supposed to be somewhere else [in our life]. I have a hard time letting go.""

A few months in Norway will give them some perspective, says Ivar.

""We would have felt worse if it was something that we should have seen coming. I think we did everything we could, and I am at peace with that. I feel like we're pretty lucky compared with many other people. I know we will continue the journey.""

'Our car is in Tanzania: we could be fined €1,400'

Many overlanders who have abandoned their vehicles are risking penalties, from fines to confiscation, for failing to drive their van out of the country by the time agreed when they entered. When you drive into a country you usually temporarily import the vehicle for a fixed period, after which penalties begin to be imposed.

Armin and Tanja, from Germany, were driving their 2004 Mitsubishi camper through Tanzania, as part of a planned two-year trip through the Balkans, Africa and South America, when the pandemic struck. Initially hoping to stick it out, they eventually decided to take one of the last repatriation flights out.

""We found a place to store the car safely on private ground. If we hadn't have found that place we definitely would not have left our camper behind,"" says Armin.

Their carnet de passage - a type of vehicle permit that has a cash deposit related to the value of the car - will expire in June. Attempts to arrange special dispensation with the customs authorities before they left were unsuccessful, and they have so far been unable to get hold of the right people in Tanzania to help them.

Image copyright Armin and Tanja

""The penalty for an expired carnet in Tanzania would be €1,400 in our case, as it is 20% of the carnet car value. We are lucky that we have quite an old car but still we hope to get out of this without paying. We will ask for a flexible solution,"" says Armin.

The delay has caused them to cut out the South America leg of their world trip, but they hope to return to Africa by September.

105,The coronavirus conundrum when your mouth is your ‘hand’,https://bbc.com/news/disability-52402482,[],"Image copyright Geoff Adams-Spink

Many disabled people face difficulties adapting their routines to stay safe during the coronavirus pandemic. Thalidomide Society chairman Geoff Adams-Spink reveals some thalidomide survivors have been left perplexed after realising how often they use their mouths and feet for tasks, instead of their hands.

It was a friend and fellow thalidomide survivor, Berrisford, who first alerted me and other members of our community to the added dangers posed by coronavirus.

Thalidomide was a morning sickness drug given to pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s, but it typically caused shortening of limbs for the babies born. For both Berrisford and me, it affected our arms.

In a Facebook post for friends, Berrisford described the great lengths he had gone to in order to remain safe while out on a shopping trip just after Covid-19 hit Europe and the US.

He explained that he meticulously swabbed his supermarket trolley and maintained social distancing at all times.

He took his goodies home in the knowledge he had kept himself safe having followed the government's guidelines. A good job well done.

At home, hungry and tempted by the food in front of him, he grabbed something that looked tasty and tore into the packet in a way he has done for most of his life - with his teeth.

Despites all of those elaborate precautions he had momentarily forgotten he often relies on his mouth instead of his hands for such tasks.

Image copyright Geoff Adams-Spink

His hygiene routine had effectively been thwarted by a rumbling stomach and a workaround that many of us with shorter arms have used several times each day for decades.

So how do you deal with coronavirus when you use your mouth for simple tasks, instead of your hands?

It surely doesn't need to be pointed out that the hand-washing principles aren't as effective for my friend or me in this situation as for many others.

But putting something in your mouth that has come from a public place could potentially transfer the virus straight to your body - it would be a very direct transmission.

Many Thalidomide survivors use the same mouth-trick as Berrisford for the sake of simplicity and speed. My dentist constantly reminds me that opening bottles with my teeth (the screw top kind, don't worry) will result in lasting damage. Correction, has already resulted in some lasting damage.

But at the moment, life with coronavirus means taking care to wash all my shopping once I return home, before I open a packet and devour the contents. Or I can ask someone within my household to help me, providing they have washed their hands first.

It's not just our mouths that can cause dilemmas. A lot has already been written about the difficulty some disabled people face in trying to maintain the 2m (6ft) distance from care givers - if somebody is washing my hair in the shower, they are in the danger zone, as am I.

Image copyright Geoff Adams-Spink Image caption Many Thalidomide survivors have learned to use their feet in place of hands

Thalidomide survivors are all around the same age - heading into our 60s - but we now face a whole new set of challenges to untangle related to this pandemic. We'll have to wait for a vaccine before we can go back to using some of our old tricks and workarounds again. In my friend's characteristically poignant words: ""We have to rewrite the 'how to' book (again)"".

This got me thinking - could there be an upside, as well as a downside, to living with upper limb impairment?

Although we do use our mouths and our chins a lot, perhaps to guide a pen or maybe to open a packet of crisps, many of us are extremely adept at using our feet to do things at waist level or below.

For example, I will automatically open and close doors or flush the toilet using my feet, which don't go anywhere near my face or mouth. And at the end of the day, those socks go into the wash.

Image copyright NEIL HALL Image caption No toilet roll, no problem

When I saw videos of people fighting over toilet rolls, forgive me, but I felt a little bit smug.

In common with many other thalidomide survivors who have short arms, I have used a bidet or shower toilet since childhood - I even have a portable one for use while travelling.

We are therefore among the very few people who have not had to stress about toilet paper being in short supply.

It's all too easy to think yourself into a passive, victim mentality when it comes to coronavirus but disabled people are ingenious problem solvers - life hacks are what we do all the time to get by.

Living through this extraordinary episode will call for vast reserves of lateral thinking, creativity and ingenuity. As disabled people, we already have those things in spades.

106,"Uzma Khan: An actress assaulted, a jealous wife and a viral video in Pakistan",https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-52842720,"['M Ilyas Khan', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Uzmakhan/FB Image caption Uzma Khan went to the police and wants the people who attacked her to be arrested

Police in Pakistan are investigating three women over the assault of a well-known actress in her home, after footage posted on social media went viral and the actress lodged a case.

The video shows three women and about a dozen armed guards entering Uzma Khan's house in Lahore. They smash up property and interrogate and assault the actress and her sister.

Despite her celebrity and such a dramatic sequence of events, the incident has barely made it into the Pakistani media.

This is probably because two of the women alleged to be involved in the attack have been named as the daughters of one of Pakistan's most powerful property magnates, Malik Riaz - and the media is wary of running stories about his family.

The influential property tycoon has distanced himself from what happened, saying he had no involvement in what he called ""disgraceful incidents"".

His daughters have not made any public comment but the other woman who has been named in the police report, Amena Usman Malik, has.

She has defended her actions in another video, and accused the actress Uzma Khan of having an affair with her husband.

Although there is little in the mainstream media, social media has been consumed by the drama, which provides some insight into the personal enmities and politics of the country's elite - as well as the media's reluctance to tackle certain issues.

What do the videos show?

The incident happened on Saturday night, just before the Eid festival at the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. After a number of videos were shared on social media, police announced they were launching an investigation on Wednesday.

They have registered a formal complaint against the three women and their guards for allegedly breaking and entering the actress's residence, beating up her and her sister and damaging their property.

In one video a woman can be heard questioning Ms Khan about her relations with the questioner's husband, Usman Malik. The woman asking the questions is allegedly Amena Usman Malik, said to be a niece of Malik Riaz's son-in-law.

It is alleged in the police complaint that she was accompanied by two of the tycoon's daughters, Amber and Pashmina Malik.

Another video shows the women abusing and harassing Ms Khan and her sister Huma. Broken glass and possessions are shown strewn around the property, as well as blood stains on the floor.

One of the woman can be heard threatening Ms Khan and her sister with kidnapping by the military's feared ISI intelligence service. The ISI is widely accused of illegally disappearing people, a charge the military denies.

In a third video, a visibly distressed Uzma Khan said she and her sister had just ended their aitekaf (a period of 3-10 days of worship in isolation during the last days of Ramadan) on the eve of Eid when Usman Malik, the husband of Amena, called to offer Eid greetings.

Soon afterwards, the women and their guards crashed into the house.

Some on social media questioned why the women had directed their anger at Uzma Khan, and not the man she was accused of having an affair with.

""The most problematic way women deal with their husband's infidelity is to cast all blame on the other woman while absolving their husband of all moral obligations. This aggression & indignation should have been directed at the woman's husband!"" tweeted one observer.

In a video statement posted after footage of events inside the house went viral, Amena Usman Malik was open about having entered the property. But she did not address the allegations of assault and theft being investigated by police, or confirm the names of others who were with her.

""As far as barging into someone's home is concerned, this was not their house. This was my husband's other house which I followed him to - so basically this was my husband's home and I have every right to be there.

""I repeatedly warned this girl to save my 13-year-long marriage. This was not the first time I approached her.""

She added that ""my husband, Usman Malik has nothing to do with Malik Riaz Hussain, he's not a part of his immediate family. This is being done to malign Malik Riaz.""

She said she had also left her husband.

He has made no public comment, and the BBC has been unable to reach him.

What does the actress say?

Uzma Khan has accused the women and their private guards of trespassing, causing injuries, damaging property and taking away valuables worth five million rupees (about $31,000) from the house.

At a news conference on Thursday at which Ms Khan was present, her lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq said Usman Malik had been friends with Uzma Khan for two years.

But, the lawyer said, Ms Khan ended her relationship with him in December. Nonetheless, he had continued to visit the house off and on, reporters were told.

""Uzma has Usman's phone calls and messages saved in her phone and we will table them in the court,"" Mr Ashfaq said.

He also rejected Amena Malik's claim in her video that the house she broke into was her husband's property.

Ms Khan and her sister needed protection, he said, because their lives were at risk, and he called for the immediate arrest of those named in the police complaint.

The two other women named in the complaint have not made any public comment, and neither have any of the guards.

Why has the media been quiet?

In most countries, this kind of story would be splashed all over the headlines. But not in Pakistan.

The property magnate - and father of two of the women named - Malik Riaz swiftly threatened to file a defamation suit ""against anyone who tries to implicate me wrongfully for such disgraceful incidents"".

Skip Twitter post by @MalikRiaz_ I categorically rebut this malicious propaganda associating me with a viral video.Usman is not my nephew.I'm appalled at such below the belt attempt to malign me for something I'm not involved in any capacity. (1/2) — Malik Riaz Hussain (@MalikRiaz_) May 27, 2020 Report

Barring one or two exceptions, the Pakistani media has remained quiet on the issue.

108,Coronavirus: Belgian zoo comes back to life from lockdown,https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-52831021,"['Kevin Connolly', 'Bbc News']","Image caption This elephant has been taking the lockdown in its stride

If you didn't know better you'd swear the elephants at the Park Pairi Daiza zoological gardens held a morning meeting. They line up with extraordinary discipline and precision on a keeper's word of command and then dissolve into a friendly huddle.

It is a ritual that has played out without an audience every day since Belgium went into lockdown at midnight on Friday 13 March.

Now the park, its name is derived from the Ancient Persian concept of paradise as a harmonious garden, is slowly emerging from confinement, as it's known in French.

Image caption Social distancing is playing a big part in the zoo's reopening

The process will be slow and gradual.

At first there'll be a maximum of 5,000 visitors instead of the 30,000 the park is capable of welcoming. They'll wear masks, they'll socially distance and they'll follow carefully marked one-way pedestrian walkways.

All European governments are struggling with the issue of how far and how fast to unwind the lockdown.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Pairi Daiza has reopened but with a limit on visitors of 20% of its number last year

But zoos were among the first tourist attractions to reopen in many countries, including Denmark and Germany. Now they are reopening in France, Italy, the Czech Republic and some Spanish regions too.

The sudden shutdown demonstrated the difficult economics of zoo-keeping - even for an institution like Pairi Daiza, which has benefited from huge investment and has twice been voted European Zoo of the Year.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The animals all had to be fed and cared for while lockdown went on

Zoo spokesman Mathieu Godefroy put it like this: ""Life goes on inside a zoo and it cost a lot of money if there are no visitors to pay for it.

""During confinement, we estimate we lost €100,000 (£90,000; $110,000) every day, for the whole year of 2020 we hope to limit our loss to €30m.""

Zoos have high fixed costs. Even when lockdown reduced revenue to zero the animals had to be fed and the keepers paid to care for them.

Image copyright AFP Image caption This four-year-old panda is among the highlights of the zoo

Being allowed to reopen at reduced capacity is helpful to zoos but offers little comfort to the operators of theme parks. There's no economically viable way to apply social distancing rules to a rollercoaster.

Among the first wave of visitors were families with small children mesmerised by the opportunity to be out in the fresh air and the bright spring sunshine.

""He's looking forward to seeing a hippopotamus,"" one mother told me about her son. ""But today he's really just as excited to be out of the house and in the car again.""

Belgium has so far reopened shops but not restaurants.

Zoos are the only places of public entertainment allowed to start trading again, simply because they're mainly places of outdoor entertainment and scientists are confident that outdoors is less dangerous than indoors.

The zoo staff are confident that excitement at the reopening isn't confined to the human public.

Elephant manager Rob Conachie, whose job is a real labour of love, said one elephant in particular, Mala, was effectively used as an ambassador to introduce visitors to the herd.

Image caption Rob Conachie says Mala and the other elephants missed their visitors

The zoo's herd gathered in a trumpeting, friendly mob as we talked while the zoo's gates opened and the crowds filed in.

""Mala is normally fed a lot of carrots,"" Rob told us, ""and in lockdown she's definitely been wondering where all the carrots have gone. The elephants are fine but there's no doubt they do miss visitors.""

Now slowly the lockdown is easing and the zoo is coming back to life. The human visitors are delighted of course but it doesn't take much imagination to believe that their excitement is shared by the elephants.

119,Hong Kong: What is the BNO and what does the UK move mean?,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52844353,[],"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Around 300,000 in Hong Kong hold a British National (Overseas) passport

The UK has said it is considering more rights for holders of a special passport issued to some people in Hong Kong.

The territory, which used to be a British colony, was handed back to China in 1997. Anyone born before then is eligible to apply for a British National (Overseas) passport, known as a BNO.

If China implements a controversial proposed security law, people holding the BNO, could get a ""path to citizenship"", the UK said.

What is the BNO and who has one?

The BNO passport is essentially a travel document that does not carry citizenship rights with it - although you are entitled to some consular assistance outside of Hong Kong and China with it.

It was issued to people in Hong Kong by the UK before Hong Kong was handed over to China.

Around 300,000 people currently hold a BNO passport, allowing them to visit the UK visa-free for six months. An estimated 2.9 million people are eligible for a BNO passport, said the British Consulate General in Hong Kong.

Though it gives the passport holder the right to remain in the UK for up to six months, it doesn't automatically allow them to reside or work there. They also aren't allowed to access public funds, including things like government benefits.

BNO holders cannot pass this status on to their children.

What is the UK proposing - and why?

China on Thursday formally approved a plan to impose controversial national security legislation in Hong Kong. It could go into effect as early as the end of June.

Hong Kong was handed back to China, on a number of conditions. These include the region's high level of autonomy and maintaining certain rights like freedom of speech that do not exist in mainland China.

But this new plan, if put into law, would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong, and many are concerned it could end Hong Kong's unique status.

The move triggered a wave of criticism around the world, with many - including Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong - urging the UK to stand up for the territory.

Image caption Under current rules, BNO holders are allowed to stay for six months

Later on Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the country would move to scrap the six-month stay limit for BNO holders if China goes on to officially implement the law.

Mr Raab said that BNO passport holders would be allowed to ""apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship"".

What difference could it make?

As a way to help people in Hong Kong who would rather not stay there if the new security laws are implemented, it might prove more symbolic.

For starters only a small percentage of people in Hong Kong currently have a BNO.

But also, the people who the security laws are aimed at - the young anti-mainland protesters who have been getting into violent confrontations with police for months - are not likely to be eligible for the BNO because of their age.

Additionally, though the BNO gives the passport holder the right to visit the UK for up to a year potentially, it's not clear what other benefits the extension might bring, or if the UK would make it any easier administratively for those already in the country to apply for work or study.

On social media, some Hong Kongers dismissed it as a gesture that amounted to little more than a 12-month tourist visa.

Effectively, it means that those who come to stay in the UK for a year, and who have the funds to be able to extend this enough, could eventually be eligible to apply for citizenship.

It cuts out some of the administrative hoops BNO holders would have had to jump through before this move if they wanted this path.

How has China reacted?

China has firmly opposed the move by the UK, saying it is a violation of the handover agreement that stipulates BNO passport holders do not enjoy UK residency.

China has repeatedly warned Britain to stay out of its affairs in Hong Kong.

The Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming had previously accused some British politicians of viewing Hong Kong ""as part of the British empire"".","The BNO passport is essentially a travel document that does not carry citizenship rights with it - although you are entitled to some consular assistance outside of Hong Kong and China with it.

120,Covid-19 plunges Indians' study abroad dreams into turmoil,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52846214,"['Nikita', 'Bbc News Delhi']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption International students are uncertain of the future in the wake of Covid-19

Two years ago, 29-year-old Raunaq Singh started working towards his dream of pursuing an MBA from one of the world's top business schools.

In January 2020, he was waitlisted by UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business in California, and was asked to send more information to bolster his case for admission.

""So, I quit my stable job of five years and started working with a mental wellness start-up as a consultant,"" Mr Singh says.

""I'm on a major pay cut because the purpose of joining this company wasn't to earn money, but to add value to my application.""

Fortunately, he was accepted at Berkeley, and was due to start his course in September.

But then the world changed as Covid-19 spread, plunging the immediate future into uncertainty.

Mr Singh is one of hundreds of thousands of Indian students who were planning to study abroad. But now they are not quite sure what will happen given international travel restrictions, new social distancing norms and the sheer uncertainty of what the next few months will bring.

After China, India sends more students abroad to study than any other country - more than one million Indians were pursuing higher education programs overseas as of July 2019, according to India's foreign ministry.

Image copyright Meehika Barua Image caption Ms Barua is one of the hundreds of thousands of Indians who wants to study abroad

Every year, in June and July, students flood visa centres and consulates to start the paperwork to travel and study abroad. But things look different this year.

""There's a lot of stress and anxiety and tension at this time but not enough clarity,"" says Meehika Barua, 23, who wants to study journalism in the UK.

""We don't know when international travel restrictions will be lifted or whether we'd be able to get our visas in time. We may also have to take classes online.""

Some universities across the UK and the US are giving international students the option to defer their courses to the next semester or year, while others have mandated online classes until the situation improves.

The University of Cambridge recently announced that lectures will be online only until next year. Others, like Greenwich University, will have a mix of online and face-to-face approaches while its international students can defer to the next semester.

""It feels a little unfair, especially after spending a year-and-half to get admission in one of these schools,"" Mr Singh says. ""Now, a part of the experience is compromised.""

Like him, many others are disappointed at the prospect of virtual classes.

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Cambridge University has announced that all lectures will be online

""The main reason we apply to these universities is to be able to get the experience of studying on campus or because we want to work in these countries. We want to absorb the culture there,"" Ms Barua says.

Studying abroad is also made more expensive by the fact that Indian and other international students will have to pay in dollars and pounds and not local currency. And then there's the additional cost of applications or standardised tests.

Virtual classes mean they don't have to pay for a visa, air tickets or living expenses. But many students are hesitant about spending their savings or borrowing money to pay for attending college in their living room.

Even if, months later, the situation improves to some extent, and students could travel abroad and enrol on campus, they say that brings its own challenges.

For one, Mr Singh points out, there is the steep cost of healthcare, and questions over access to it, as countries like the US are experiencing a deluge of infections and deaths.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Students are also unsure of finding jobs overseas after graduation

And then there are the dimming job prospects. The pandemic has squeezed the global economy, so employers are less likely to hire, or sponsor visas for foreign workers.

""For international students, the roller coaster has been more intense because there is increased uncertainty about their ability to get jobs in the US after graduation, and for some, in their ability to get to the US at all,"" says Taya Carothers, who works in Northwestern University's international student office.

The idea of returning to India with an expensive degree and the looming unemployment is scaring students - especially since for many of them, the decision to study abroad is tied to a desire to find a well-paying job there.

""The risk we take when we leave our home country and move to another country - that risk has increased manifold,"" Mr Singh adds.

The current crisis - and its economic impact - has affected the decision of nearly half the Indians who wanted to study abroad, according to a recent report by the QS, a global education network.

Experts say universities are in a tough spot too.

International students add as much as $45bn (£37bn) a year to the American economy. In the UK, universities receive almost £7bn in fees from overseas students. So their finances will take a hit if too many foreign students rethink going abroad.

And logistics will also pose a challenge - colleges have to enforce social distancing across campuses, including dormitories, and accommodate students from multiple time zones in virtual classes.

""Regardless of how good your technology is, you're still going to face problems like internet issues,"" says Sadiq Basha, who heads a study abroad consultancy.

He adds that there might be a knee-jerk reaction as a large number of international students consider deferring their admission to 2021. But he's positive that ""in the long term, the ambitions of Indian students are not going to go down.""

Mr Singh is still waiting to see how things will unfold in the next few months, but he's almost certain he will enrol and start his first semester of the two-year program online.

""Since I've been preparing for over a year now, I think mentally I'm already there,"" he says.","""So, I quit my stable job of five years and started working with a mental wellness start-up as a consultant,"" Mr Singh says.

121,George Floyd death: Why has a US city gone up in flames?,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52854037,"['Jessica Lussenhop', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Getty Images

Tensions between Minneapolis' black community and the police did not start with the death of George Floyd. They have been years in the making.

On a hot Thursday morning in the Longfellow neighbourhood of Minneapolis, a 28-year-old father named Nuwman stood outside the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct drinking a large coffee as smoke wafted past from the smouldering ruins of nearby buildings.

It was day three of protests over the death of 46-year-old George Floyd, after a white police officer named Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd begged for his life before falling unconscious and dying in the street, in full view of witnesses and a rolling mobile phone camera. Four officers, including Chauvin, were fired from the department for their involvement.

The previous night, tensions ignited, and for the first time the city saw looting, arson and violence. At least one man died in a shooting at a pawn shop.

""This is everyday. Everyday that these police officers have enforced their protocol has led up to this,"" said Nuwman, his voice rising with emotion over the din of protesters and sirens. ""This is not just a singular moment. This is a cataclysm. A combination of all the things that happened before.""

That night, protesters stormed the precinct as police cruisers flew out of the rear parking lot, abandoning it to demonstrators who quickly moved from room to room lighting blazes.

Image copyright Reuters

The following afternoon, a Friday, saw the arrest of Chauvin by Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Chauvin has been charged with murder.

This is not the first instance of a controversial, police-involved killing in the region. In 2016, Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer in a neighbourhood just 15 minutes away from the current epicentre of protest.

In 2017, a Minneapolis officer was charged with the shooting death of Justine Damond after she called to report a possible sexual assault. In 2015, protests erupted over the shooting death of Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old man who was being pursued by Minneapolis officers.

All three deaths sparked protest movements and yielded mixed results in terms of prosecution. Yanez was tried and acquitted. Mohamed Noor, Damond's shooter, was sentenced to 12.5 years. No charges were brought in Clark's case.

For some, Floyd's death was the continuation of those stories.

""WE SHOULD HAVE BURNT THE CITY DOWN FOR PHILANDO CASTILE,"" one person posted on social media.

But in some ways, the pictures beamed around the world this week tell a story that's unique.

Demonstrations are occurring in the midst of a historic, global pandemic. The sheer amount of property damage and arson has been staggering. The swiftness with which officers were fired, and the speed in which Chauvin was arrested and charged surprised many.

But Minneapolis - while a prosperous city that celebrates liberal policies and politicians - has struggled for years with socioeconomic inequality and segregation. It's a phenomena that's been dubbed the ""Minnesota paradox"".

The Twin Cities, as Minneapolis and St Paul are known, are still overwhelmingly white - about one-quarter of the population is non-white - and its neighbourhoods are still highly segregated. Most people of colour live on the cities' north sides.

They were shaped by racist red-lining policies dating to the early 20th Century, when black families were not allowed to buy homes in certain neighbourhoods. In the 1960s, the state built a major highway that cut through and destroyed a thriving black community known as Rondo in St Paul.

According to a 2018 study, the rate of black homeownership in the Twin Cities is among the lowest in the nation.

Even before the pandemic caused massive layoffs, 10% of black residents were unemployed compared to 4% of whites. That disparity ranks as one of the nation's worst.

In 2016, the average white household in the Twin Cities made about $76,000 a year, while the average black household earned just $32,000. Thirty-two percent of black Twin Citians fell below the poverty line, while only 6.5% of whites did.

Racial disparities persist in the way the community is policed.

After Philando Castile was killed, data released about police traffic stops in the area showed that 44% of stops were black drivers, though the population was only 7% black.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protests spread to other cities including New York City

According to the Minneapolis police department's own data, in 2018 55% of drivers stopped for ""equipment violations"" were black.

As Covid-19 ravages the area, these disparities are sure to worsen, as thousands lose their jobs, and their homes to evictions and foreclosures.

On Friday afternoon, residents of both St Paul and Minneapolis headed into the streets carrying brooms and pails, and slowly began to literally pick up the pieces of the town.

Following the announcement that former officer Chauvin had been jailed and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, protesters at Minneapolis City Hall let up a cheer.

But it was quickly replaced by a new demand: ""One down, three to go.""

122,Akinwumi Adesina: Why the US is targeting a flamboyant Nigerian banker,https://bbc.com/news/world-africa-52831185,[],"Image copyright Getty Images

The US and the African Development Bank have fallen out over allegations of corruption against the bank's Nigerian head, writes former BBC Africa Business editor Larry Madowo.

Akinwumi Adesina is a sharp dresser known for his expensive tailored suits, immaculate white shirts and an endless supply of colourful bow ties.

But the clean public persona of the 60-year-old president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) is now being questioned after a string of corruption and abuse of office allegations from his own staff spilled into the open. Mr Adesina has denied all the allegations.

The board of governors of the 55-year-old institution met on Tuesday to discuss whether to bring in an outside investigator into the allegations concerning the Nigerian's conduct just days after the US rejected an initial inquiry that cleared him.

The prospects of an independent probe comes only three months before he was expected to be re-elected unopposed at its annual general meeting in August.

US at odds with Africa

The 20-point allegations of ""impunity and bad governance"" from unnamed employees have exposed a rift between Mr Adesina and ordinary staff.

The ""Group of Concerned Staff Members of the AfDB"" claimed that Mr Adesina has used the bank's resources for self-promotion and personal gain while also paying out huge but undeserved severance packages to staff who resigned mysteriously, and favouring his fellow Nigerians.

US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin personally signed a letter to the board rejecting an internal investigation that cleared Mr Adesina.

""Mnuchin's move is significant because it has now cast a limelight on governance issues and on [the] importance of an independent investigation to uphold the integrity of the AfDB,"" said Barbara Barungi, the bank's former lead economist on Nigeria. ""There are very few people that were willing to stick their necks out.""

Besides the core 54 African countries, the US is one of the 27 non-regional members of the AfDB and its second largest shareholder.

AfDB's 10 biggest shareholders:

Nigeria: 9.1%; US: 6.5%; Egypt: 5.5%; Japan: 5.4%;

9.1%; 6.5%; 5.5%; 5.4%; South Africa: 4.9% Algeria: 4.1%; Germany: 4%;

4.9% 4.1%; 4%; Canada: 3.8%; Ivory Coast: 3.7%; France: 3.6%

""I think AfDB is Africa's most valuable institution,"" said one insider who spoke on condition of anonymity.

""But what you have now is the biggest paymaster, the US, in a stand-off against the Africans. If you read Mnuchin's letter carefully, it has put the bank on notice.""

The BBC has obtained the original whistleblowers' email from January 2020, sent to two executive directors of the bank, Yano Takuji (Japanese) and Steven Dowd (American), and the British director for its Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department Alan Bacarese.

In an April update circulated to a wider pool of senior managers, the whistleblowers said the Ethics Committee headed by Mr Takuji failed to examine their concerns.

The committee later carried out an investigation and declared that Mr Adesina was ""totally exonerated of all allegations made against him"" and recommended that the board of governors adopt its conclusions.

In early May, the board's chair - Ivorian Planning Minister Nialé Kaba - wrote to shareholders that the African finance ministers who supervise the bank's management intended to clear Mr Adesina.

""We fear that the wholesale dismissal of all allegations without appropriate investigation will tarnish the reputation of this institution as one that does not uphold high standards of ethics and governance,"" Mr Mnuchin wrote back.

""Therefore, the United States cannot support dismissing the allegations at this stage,"" he added.

Mr Kaba said in a statement that a decision had not been made about Mr Adesina and he remained in office.

""The bureau, which I chair, wishes to reassure the public that it is seized with the matter and it is treating it with the utmost seriousness that it deserves,"" he said.

'Trumped up allegations'

The whistleblowers have accused Mr Adesina of major conflicts of interest in his dealings with current and former employees, unethical conduct and preferential treatment.

Eight things about Akinwumi Adesina:

First Nigerian to lead AfDB

Elected for five-year term in September 2015

Was Nigeria's agriculture minister from 2011 until his move

Named Forbes Africa Person of the Year in 2013 for his ""bold reforms"" in farming sector

Was told by an academic in Nigeria he would never get into Purdue University as his maths was poor

Proved him wrong by getting into the prestigious US institution

Cancelled his admission to UK's respected Cambridge University

Got his PhD in agricultural economics in 1998

Mr Adesina, who holds a PhD in agricultural economics from Purdue University in the US, did not respond to BBC requests for comment but released a statement.

""In spite of unprecedented attempts by some to tarnish my reputation and prejudice the bank's governance procedures, I maintain my innocence with regard to trumped up allegations that unjustly seek to impugn my honour and integrity,"" he wrote.

""I am confident that fair, transparent and just processes that respect the rules, procedures and governance systems of the Bank, and rule of law, will ultimately prove that I have not violated the Code of Ethics of this extraordinary institution.""

The AfDB board meeting is said to have agreed to an independent investigation into the allegations concerning Mr Adesina's conduct after Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland supported the US position, Bloomberg news agency first reported.

""Should it surprise the world that we're getting a second investigation backed by no African country? What does that say about the other countries that have lined up behind the US?"" wonders Debisi Araba, a friend of Mr Adesina's.

""He's due to run unopposed but you want to muddy the waters with this stain of corruption. I believe he will be vindicated.""

Zimbabwe: $13.7m grant approved to improve health sector

Mr Araba worked for Mr Adesina in the Nigerian government and was also an intern at the bank while doing his PhD in 2009.

He says the bank has always had a culture of salacious rumour and gossip but faults the US for formalizing the ""crass, bargain basement reasoning"" into a complaint.

This was denied by a US Treasury spokesperson, who told the BBC: ""The United States continues to value the AfDB and its efforts to promote development, reduce poverty, and address the current health and economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the African continent.""

Chinese 'shopping spree in Africa'

Some policy analysts at think-tanks in Washington, DC, worry about the timing of the American pushback and its longer-term consequences in Africa.

""A prolonged battle will be a distraction for the AfDB when its resources are more desperately needed than ever for its borrowers,"" Nancy Birdsall, a Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development told the BBC.

She said it was not good for the AfDB if Mr Mnuchin was unhappy and suggested that ""the US Treasury should look for some form of quiet compromise in which no-one loses face"".

Ms Birdsall also reiterated a recommendation she made in a 2018 paper for the leadership of the AfDB to open up its shareholding, including to China and oil-rich economies.

But Daniel F Runde, senior vice-president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, disagreed.

He said the Abidjan-based bank that lends exclusively to African governments represented one of the few non-China-led and western-funded approaches to development on the continent.

""If Adesina is cleared, the US may need to mend fences with the management because China will probably go on a shopping spree in Africa after Covid-19, and we will need every non-Chinese tool to respond,"" he said.

Mr Runde saw Mr Mnuchin's letter as ""disruption"" and called it a good tactic but a poor strategy.

""Now that the Trump administration has caused disruption and perhaps made a point, they have to decide when this plays out,"" he said.

Getty Independent accountability measures strengthen institutions and reinforce their legitimacy""

Last October, the 81 shareholders of the bank pledged extra funds to more than double its capital to $208bn (£170bn).

Missouri Congressman Emmanuel Cleaver, who sponsored a bill backing the capital increase in the US House of Representatives, came out in support of the new inquiry.

""Independent accountability measures strengthen institutions and reinforce their legitimacy - both domestically and internationally. I am pleased the African Development Bank's Board agreed to take this important step,"" the Democrat told the BBC in a statement.

Mr Adesina is an eloquent advocate for Africa and the bank and a good fundraiser, but his detractors say he promises more than he delivers.

""His administration hasn't always been fantastic and perhaps he has run roughshod over some people. Maybe the practices haven't always been what they should be, and the feeling is that the board just whitewashed the investigation,"" the insider said.

Accused of favouring Nigerians

The whistleblowers also accused Mr Adesina of preferential treatment for Nigeria and Nigerians.

""I don't think we should trivialise the issues and reduce them to anti-Nigerian sentiment,"" said Ms Barungi, the Ugandan-born, Lagos-based former bank employee.

""It's really more about governance concerns that require attention and the investigation to help clear the air,"" she added.

Mr Araba, a Nigerian, said talk of the ""Nigerianisation of the bank"" was false as the country was under-represented in employee numbers despite being the largest shareholder.

As the crisis at the bank escalates, employees, consultants and government officials in African capitals, as well as American foreign policy nerds, wonder how this impasse will end.

But at the Treasury building right next to the White House, Mr Mnuchin and his advisors are doubling down.

""Undertaking an independent evaluation of facts is not at odds with a presumption of innocence, and by promoting transparency and good governance, it can only strengthen the AfDB's capacity to deliver results to people across Africa,"" the spokesman told the BBC.

123,Tech Tent: Trump versus Twitter,https://bbc.com/news/technology-52853168,"['Rory Cellan-Jones', 'Technology Correspondent']","Image copyright Reuters / Getty Images Image caption Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, has had much to deal with this week

For years, Twitter resisted calls to treat President Trump just like any other user. Then this week, everything changed.

On Tech Tent, we examine the conflict between the president and his favourite social media platform.

It began on Wednesday. Twitter had been under fire for allowing tweets in which the president shared a far-fetched conspiracy theory about an alleged crime involving a TV presenter and former Republican congressman.

But instead of taking action on those tweets, it fact-checked two others - about postal voting under a new policy which seeks to deter content which might suppress voting.

Social media expert Chris Stokel-Walker tells Tech Tent that if Twitter thought limiting action to the area of elections was a cautious first step, it was wrong.

""As soon as you start engaging in any sort of moderation or comment on politics, you run the risk of potentially alienating 50% of your audience - and given our very politically fractious times, that is more of a risk than ever,"" he said.

Having taken that first step, and seeing President Trump immediately go nuclear and threatening to go so far as to shut the social media platform down, Twitter might have been tempted to go quiet for a bit.

Instead, it chose escalation.

In the early hours of Friday morning, in a tweet about the protests in Minneapolis over the death of a black man, Mr Trump warned: ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"".

Twitter's moderation team swung into action - after consulting CEO Jack Dorsey - and obscured the tweet with a message saying that rules on glorifying violence had been broken.

Users could still see the tweet by clicking through that message, but sharing it was made harder.

A few hours later, as the president woke up, the official White House account simply repeated the offending tweet. We watched with bated breath to see what would happen and, sure enough, Twitter's moderators slapped the same warning on the tweet.

It is difficult to see either side backing down now.

The White House is busy scouring Twitter to find examples of other world leaders who have glorified violence without any comeback. Others are finding all sorts of old Trump tweets that appear to have broken the rules by, for instance, spreading misinformation about treatments for coronavirus.

Jack Dorsey, who had appeared very reluctant to apply anything but the most light-touch regulation, now finds himself faced with the unappealing prospect of cracking down on world leaders far and wide.

Meanwhile, there is not exactly much solidarity being shown by Facebook.

In general, it has been a more tightly-moderated platform than Twitter, but Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear he has no intention of following Jack Dorsey's lead when it comes to fact checking politicians. Donald Trump's Facebook page has simply replicated the posts which fell foul of Twitter - with no sign of fact-checking or finger-wagging.

""This is the kind of thing that Donald Trump revels in,"" says Chris Stokel-Walker, ""an ex-reality TV star who likes to stir the pot. He's now managed to set Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey against each other.""

For all the rage about freedom of speech from the president - and remember Twitter as a private company can do what it likes in that area - he seems unlikely to kill what has become his main platform for getting his message out.

Like the fighting couple in some dodgy romcom, Trump and Twitter need each other - though one suspects Jack Dorsey might be tempted to throw the President out and change the locks.","Image copyright Reuters / Getty Images Image caption Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, has had much to deal with this weekFor years, Twitter resisted calls to treat President Trump just like any other user.

124,'You can't ask people to die': Coronavirus woes deepen Argentina's crisis,https://bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52846939,"['Katy Watson', 'Bbc South America Correspondent']","Image caption Sergio works as a cartonero - collecting litter on the streets of Buenos Aires

Sergio Sanchez, 56, has lived through enough defaults and crises to know that Argentina's economy can be a rollercoaster. Politicians come and go but economic troubles rarely go away.

""Some governments have been better than others,"" Sergio says. But the coronavirus pandemic has had a far bigger impact than any politician. ""It doesn't care if you're good or bad, rich or poor.""

Sergio's life was turned upside down when Argentina's economy crashed in 2001- the worst economic crisis in the country's history.

Argentina defaulted on a debt of $132bn - at the time, it was the largest sovereign default ever. The peso lost much of its value overnight and banks stopped allowing people to take their money out. There were protests, businesses closed, and unemployment and poverty soared.

Sergio lost his job as a driver and became a cartonero, collecting litter on the streets of Buenos Aires - ""I had no option.""

But that also brought change, says Sergio. People came together. They fought to make life better.

The economic collapse saw the numbers of cartoneros flourish. Sergio now heads one of the biggest cartonero co-operatives in the country.

And three times a week he helps run a soup kitchen in the south of Buenos Aires.

With a visor and a clipboard in hand, Sergio oversees volunteers chopping up meat and pumpkin, ready for the onslaught of people in need of food.

""We started off with an average of five to six hundred people [a day],"" says Sergio of his soup kitchen, which has been going for three years. ""Last year it got to 1,200 and that shocked us. Now, it's anything between 3,000 and 6,000 we try to help.""

Covid-19 and economic crisis

When Europe was struggling to contain coronavirus, Argentina reacted by locking down early. The tough measures introduced by President Alberto Fernández have paid off in some respects. To date, Argentina has recorded around 15,000 cases and just over 500 deaths - far lower than neighbours like Brazil.

But it's come at a huge economic cost.

""It was already pretty bad for us but with this, it's just got worse,"" says 21-year-old Omar, who is standing in the queue for the soup kitchen. ""The economy has collapsed as far as I'm concerned.""

Restructuring talks

On May 22, Argentina defaulted on a $500m interest payment - the ninth default in its history - and it's currently in talks with bondholders over restructuring $65bn in foreign debt.

It said that with an economic crisis worsened by the pandemic, it was unable to pay its debts. But no agreement with bondholders has yet been reached. They've pushed back the restructuring deadline to 2 June 2 in an effort to come to a deal.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption A sign says: ""No to the payment of the debt. Break with the IMF""

""I think [default is] a ghost that's been walking around our country for so many years now, I don't think we're even afraid of it,"" says Constanza Guillén, an activist who's helping out at the kitchen. ""The problem is how do we get out of this?""

A changed world

""[Argentina] wants to pay what they owe to the extent they are able to pay but you can't ask people to die to pay creditors,"" says Professor Joseph Stiglitz, one of more than 100 economists from across the world who wrote a letter calling for a constructive approach to the negotiation.

""They are playing as if the world hadn't changed,"" Professor Stiglitz says of bondholders. ""The pandemic has made it clear that we have a global problem and when you make loans, you know there's a risk.""

Not far from the soup kitchen is Vila 21-24, one of Buenos Aires' largest slums. It's these poor - and crowded - neighbourhoods that have seen an alarming rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks.

""I never thought I'd go hungry again - or be unable to provide for my daughters,"" says 36-year-old Maira Ledezma, referring to the experience she had back in 2001.

Image caption Maira (pictured) recalls the difficulty of the last serious economic crisis

""Sure, I was paid badly but at least I had something,"" she says of her seamstress work, but with inflation at around 50%, she fears the worsening crisis will add to her struggles. ""It'll make it twice as hard to get to the end of the month.""

Empanadas for delivery

Husband-and-wife duo Florencia Barrientos Paz and Gonzalo Alderete Pagés are making just 20% of what they normally do at their restaurant Santa Evita in trendy Palermo. They've had to turn their restaurant into a delivery business. On the wall of the dining room is a smiling mural of the Argentinian icon Eva Perón. They aren't feeling so positive.

""It's like wartime, and we have to take every precaution possible, because if one of our people gets ill, we have to close again,"" says Gonzalo, who's cooking up empanadas in the kitchen. ""And if we have to close again, we can't survive.""

Image caption The new restructuring deadline is just days away

Florencia, though, is a little more sanguine.

""The truth is, we Argentines are used to being beaten up,"" she says. ""We have fallen hard and developed coping strategies, especially when it comes to the economy.""

So does she feel positive about the future?

""See this mask I have to wear? It's a bit like that - the reality is so present, I can't get think about anything else.""

However, Professor Stiglitz says there's a lot riding on the success of Argentina's debt negotiations.

""If in the midst of this crisis, there's no humanity shown, no reason - and anyone understands you can't squeeze water out of a stone - people are going to turn against market economies more generally,"" he says.

""They are going to say, what's the nature of finance?

125,Coronavirus: Bill Gates ‘microchip’ conspiracy theory and other vaccine claims fact-checked,https://bbc.com/news/52847648,"['Jack Goodman', 'Flora Carmichael', 'Bbc Reality Check']","Image copyright TOBIAS SCHWARZ Image caption Conspiracy theorists around the world have put Bill Gates at the heart of their stories

Speculation about a future coronavirus vaccine is ramping up and social-media posts from anti-vaccination campaigners are gaining more traction online.

We've been debunking a few recent claims.

Why the microchip rumours don't stack up

First up, a conspiracy theory about vaccines that has spanned the globe.

It claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it.

We've found no evidence to support these claims.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was ""false"".

The head of the Russian Communist party this week said that so-called ""globalists"" supported ""a covert mass chip implantation which they may in time resort to under the pretext of a mandatory vaccination against coronavirus"".

He didn't mention Mr Gates by name but in the US, Roger Stone, a former adviser to Donald Trump, said Bill Gates and others were using the virus for ""microchipping people so we can tell 'whether you've been tested'.""

A new YouGov poll of 1,640 people suggests that 28% of Americans believe that Bill Gates wants to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans.

Rumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually ""we will have some digital certificates"" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips.

That response led to one widely shared article, under the headline: ""Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus"".

The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection.

However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says: ""The reference to 'digital certificates' relates to efforts to create an open-source digital platform with the goal of expanding access to safe, home-based testing.""

Bill Gates did not say this about a vaccine

The Microsoft billionaire has been the target of many different false rumours about vaccines.

A recent post on a UK-based Twitter account said: ""Bill Gates admits the vaccine will no doubt kill 700,000 people"" and links to a video featuring right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

The claim in the tweet, which has had more than 45,000 retweets and likes, is false and misrepresents Gates' words.

In the video, Mr Gates is talking about the efficacy of vaccines in older people and cautions about the risk of side-effects.

He sets out a hypothetical situation about the potential harm of side-effects, saying:""If we have one in 10,000 side-effects, that's way more... 700,000 people who will suffer from that.""

He does not ""admit"" 700,000 will die from a vaccine.

Conspiracy theories about Bill Gates have reached the Italian Parliament, where an independent MP called for Bill Gates to be referred to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.

Pandemic for profit?

There is a strong anti-vaccination movement in Italy.

One popular Italian video, which has been viewed more than 700,000 times on Facebook, has a caption claiming that the pandemic has been ""invented"".

The narrator of the clip is Stefano Montanari, an Italian researcher with a degree in pharmacology, who claims the end goal is to get everyone vaccinated.

He argues that the epidemic ""will continue to be totally made-up"" until there is a vaccine that ""will bring money and corruption into the already full pockets of some"".

He concludes: ""This is a sensational hoax, but a very successful one.""

There is no evidence whatsoever to support his theory that the pandemic is a hoax. It is true that whichever pharmaceutical company develops a vaccine could potentially profit from the success, but the idea that this potential profit would be a motive to invent a pandemic is far-fetched.

Image caption The meme features an image of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Cow-dung vaccine?

A Facebook meme announcing a ""wonder drug to battle corona"" and a ""cow-dung vaccine"" has been shared widely on Facebook in India.

Some of the posts, including one shared more than 1,000 times, link to a front-page story from the Ahmedabad Mirror, which reports that a trial of medicine derived from cow's milk, butter, ghee, dung and urine is under way.

The cow is considered sacred in Hinduism and some Hindu groups have claimed that drinking cow urine could boost immunity against the virus - a claim we've looked at before.

However, there is no scientific evidence to support this theory, and the trial described in the Ahmedabad Mirror does not mention testing cow dung as a vaccine or prophylactic treatment.

The article quotes a doctor as saying: ""Cow urine is known to have medicinal components that can cure Covid-19."" In fact there is no known cure for coronavirus.

We asked Dr Rajni Kant, a biologist and head of research at the Indian Council for Medical Research, about the use of cow urine or dung as a treatment.

She said: ""We don't have any significant evidence or study to quote that these have any efficacy against Covid-19. We don't have significant evidence or study to quote anything.""

The Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog, part of India's Ministry of Agriculture, confirmed there will be trials for a Covid treatment combining cow urine, dung, butter, ghee and milk - but not a vaccine.

126,"Amazon under threat: Fires, loggers and now virus",https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-51300515,"['Camilla Costa', 'Visual Journalism Americas']","So what is driving deforestation in each of the Amazon nations, how much primary forest have they lost and what are their governments doing?

""People have no idea what it would mean to lose this magnificent hydrological system.""

Antonio Nobre says: ""The ring made by central-southern Brazil and the River Plate basin would be a desert if it wasn't for the Amazon.

It affects the ecosystem of the whole region, including those who are not part of the Amazon itself, and beyond.

More than 33 million people live in the Amazon - about 8% of the population of South America - in towns, cities, riverside communities and indigenous villages. There are at least 100 tribes who have had little or no contact with outsiders.

Deforestation and its causes are a major source of friction between the governments of the nine Amazon nations, environmentalists, companies and indigenous groups: the desire for economic development clashes, in the main, with the preservation of the Amazon and its native peoples .

That doesn't seem an easy task in the near future.

""If we could restore 60,000 or 70,000 sq km in this large area, where the dry season is already much longer, we could help the forest get back to working better and it would be more resilient.""

""First, we should adopt a zero deforestation policy in Panamazonas, immediately, together with a reforestation programme in the south, south-east and east of the Amazon, which are the most vulnerable areas.""

According to Carlos Nobre, there is a way.

""Replacing the rainforest with another ecosystem, this increase could be even greater or could happen sooner.""

""Even if the conditions we have at the moment stay the same, temperatures in the Amazon region could increase by 8C, taking into account deforestation and global warming by 2070.

And temperature increases could lead to more heat-related cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, says Beatriz Oliveira, from Brazil's Climate Change Investigations Network (Red-Clima).

The process of degradation could make the insects look for other sources of food and get closer to urban settlements.

Some studies link deforestation to an increase in illnesses transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria and leishmaniasis.

This could have a catastrophic impact on the local economy. Less rain and higher temperatures mean less water for animals or growing crops like soya.

But Brazilian climatologist Carlos Nobre, says temperatures in the region could increase by 1.5-3C in the areas which become degraded savannahs. And that is without taking into account possible increases already caused by global warming.

Scientists can't say exactly what a sudden transformation of the Amazon rainforest would mean.

This means it could be even closer than they think. But what could happen after the tipping point?

The projection, however, still does not take into account degradation because of the difficulty of measuring it across Panamazonas - the joint Amazon biome across the different national borders.

It would cause the length of the dry season and temperatures in the forest to increase. Trees would start to die and the tropical rainforest could become more like a dry savannah.

This will happen when total deforestation reaches between 20% and 25% - and that could happen in the next 20 or 30 years.

We could be dangerously close to what scientists call ""the tipping point"" - when the nature of the Amazon will completely change.

If deforestation and degradation continue at current levels, the Amazon could stop working as a tropical ecosystem, even if some of it is still standing.

Among the Amazon countries, only Brazil regularly publishes annual degradation figures. However, scientists from across the region are trying to produce the relevant data to form a wider picture of the current state of the forest.

""It is a difficult phenomenon to measure because although you can see degradation on satellite images, you need to have data from the ground to understand the real picture - whether that area is more or less degraded or is recovering,"" says Alexander Lees.

So why don't they talk about degradation when measuring forest loss in the Amazon?

A recent report by the Colombian government confirms that between 2012 and 2015, its own Amazon region lost 187,955 hectares of forest to deforestation and 414,605 hectares to degradation - more than double.

Dr Nobre says the degraded areas of the Amazon are nearly twice as big as the deforested areas.

If we take the deforestation and degradation together, more than 50% of the Amazon no longer performs environmental services for the region's climate, says Antonio Nobre.

Degradation also makes the forest less efficient. It loses, for example, the ability to generate some of its own rain.

And in seven of the nine Amazon countries, they say, degradation is the main source of their carbon dioxide emissions.

Scientists also warn that degradation is an important factor in releasing stored CO2. A new study by Raisg says 47% of all the emissions in the Amazon are as a result of degradation.

""Even though not all the vegetation is lost, the soil is drier and more fragile. This changes the microclimate of the forest and makes it easier for fires to spread because the soil heats up faster,"" explains Dr Alexander Lees, Senior Lecturer in tropical ecology at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK.

This phenomenon is as much the result of climatic events - such as drought, as human action - such as burning or illegal logging which strip the forest of its vital functions. However, seen from above, it may seem that the forest is still standing.

Experts like Antonio Nobre believe that deforestation does not show the full picture of what is being lost and we should also take into account ""degradation"".

A recent study claimed that 20% of the Amazon is already emitting more CO2 that it absorbs.

For this reason, scientists fear that the Amazon will stop being a carbon store and will instead become a serious emitter of CO2, accelerating the effects of climate change.

One of the direct effects of deforestation is that it releases CO2 stored in the forest. Forest fires or the decomposition of felled trees both transform the carbon within the tree back into gas.

According to Dr Berenguer, a large tree (with at least three metres circumference) can contain between three and four tonnes of carbon. This is the same as about 10 to 12 tonnes of CO2, or what a family car emits over four years.

The older and larger the tree, the more carbon it stores.

A small part of the CO2 absorbed by trees during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere during respiration. The rest is transformed into carbon which the trees use to produce the sugars needed for their metabolism.

Primary forest is home to trees that can be hundreds or even thousands of years old. They perform a powerful role in mitigating the effects of climate change, as they act as an enormous carbon dioxide store.

In the last 10 years, figures for primary forest loss have remained high or spiked in most of the Amazon nations.

""Each hectare deforested means part of the ecosystem ceases to function and this affects the rest,"" says Oxford University rainforest expert Erika Berenguer.

This may seem insignificant - only 0.32% of the forest in the whole Amazon biome - but it is also a question of quality.

A football pitch is frequently used as a reference because, according to Fifa, the maximum size of a pitch is 1.08 hectares. However, some countries use smaller dimensions, which is why deforestation calculations can vary so much.

Almost half of this was primary forest - 1.7 million hectares of forest that was still in its original state and rich in biodiversity. Its destruction was the same as three football pitches of virgin forest being destroyed every minute in 2018.

In 2018 alone, the tree cover loss in the Amazon reached four million hectares (40,000 sq km), according to Global Forest Watch.

The most common way of measuring deforestation is ""tree cover loss"" - where forest vegetation has been completely erased.

Scientists say that if we don't reverse current levels of deforestation and degradation, the consequences of climate change could accelerate.

Even if an area does not lose all its trees and vegetation, degradation strips the rainforest of properties that are vital to the planet.

This happens when a combination of pressures on a stretch of forest - such as fires, logging or unlicensed hunting - make it hard for the ecosystem to function properly.

To get a more complete sense of the scale of the destruction, Dr Nobre says it is necessary to take into account the figures for degradation.

""The destruction of the Amazon rainforest up till now is much bigger than the almost 20% that they talk of in the media.""

""To only speak of deforestation when we refer to the loss of the Amazon is what I call ""the great green lie"","" says climate scientist Antonio Donato Nobre.

But that is not the only problem.

Brazil and Bolivia were among the top five countries for loss of primary forest in 2018 and both saw a dramatic increase in wildfires last year.

Even before this year’s spike in deforestation, the rate across the nine Amazon countries had continued to rise.

The Brazilian authorities are deploying troops in the Amazon region to help protect the rainforest, tackle illegal deforestation and forest fires. But critics say that the government’s rhetoric and policies could actually be encouraging loggers and illegal miners.

Last year, an unprecedented number of fires devastated huge swathes of forest in the Amazon. Peak fire season is from July which some experts worry could coincide with the peak of the coronavirus crisis.

In April, as the number of cases rose and states started adopting isolation measures, deforestation actually increased 64% compared with the same month in 2019, according to preliminary satellite data from space research agency INPE.

But many of the field agents working to protect reserves have pulled out, Jonathan Mazower, of Survival International, says, allowing loggers and miners to target these areas.

As elsewhere, social distancing and travel restrictions have been imposed to limit the spread of the virus.

Since coronavirus spread to Brazil, in March, Amazonas has been the state to register Brazil's highest infection rates - it also has one of the most underfunded health systems in the country.

The largest and most diverse tropical rainforest in the world is home to 33 million people and thousands of species of plants and animals.

Here, we look at the pressures pushing the Amazon to the brink and ask what the nine countries that share this unique natural resource are doing to protect it.

Deforestation, illegal mining, land clearances and wildfires were already at an 11-year high and scientists say we're fast approaching a point of no return - after which the Amazon will no longer function as it should.

Deforestation jumped 55% in the first four months of 2020 compared with the same period last year, as people have taken advantage of the crisis to carry out illegal clearances.

The Amazon rainforest - which plays a vital role in balancing the world's climate and helping fight global warming - is also suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The fires which started in Bolivia in May 2019 destroyed almost two million hectares of forest, according to the Friends of Nature monitoring NGO.

Half of that was in protected areas, known for their wide biodiversity.

Environmentalists say Evo Morales' government has promoted deforestation with policies of selling land in the Amazon region to businessmen and distributing it to farmers.

The expansion of the farming frontier is mainly to encourage soya planting and cattle raising, in the hope of building exports for the Chinese market. In August 2019, Mr Morales celebrated the first beef exports to China from Santa Cruz.

The same region was responsible for nearly half of Bolivia's soya production in 2018 and was most affected by the fires last year.

In response to criticism during the fires crisis, Morales halted land sales in Santa Cruz for what he called ""an ecological pause"".

We asked the Bolivian environment ministry about its strategy to reduce deforestation, but have had no response.

Brazil Amazon area: 421.3 million hectares Primary forest lost: 18%

Brazil received international acclaim for the drop off in deforestation between 2004 and 2014 - an accumulated fall of 80% in almost 10 years.

But the loss of forest has once again started to rise.

In November 2019, the government published data confirming expert predictions: that between the middle of 2018 and the middle of 2019, deforestation in the Amazon had increased 30% in relation to the previous year.

They had cleared around 980,000 hectares (9,800 sq km), the largest area of forest cut down since 2008.

And these figures don't take into account August 2019, when Amazon fires were at their worst.

President Jair Bolsonaro's government claimed the fires were down to the dry season. But investigations by IPAM and the Federal University of Acre found otherwise.

According to their report, the Amazon fires are directly related to deforestation.

""After felling the trees, they leave it to dry for a few months then set fire to it to clear the vegetation. The land is then used to plant grass and create pastures,"" says Erika Berenguer.

According to the FAO, 80% of tree loss in Brazil is directly or indirectly related to cattle farming. Brazil is the largest beef exporter in the world. It makes up 7% of the country's GDP and 4.6% of exports.

Today, around 40% of the country's cattle is raised in Amazon states. But that is only part of the story.

Around 60 million hectares of the Brazilian Amazon are considered public areas, or rather they have no legal purpose defined by the government.

They are not conservation areas, nor indigenous territories, for example. People clear this land, cut the trees down and put cattle on them, it's the cheapest way to occupy them, says Stabile.

A patch of land without trees is worth more on the market.

The primary use of deforested land in Brazil is cattle. But the aim is not necessarily to earn money from meat production but from the sale of land Marcelo Stabile, of IPAM, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute

The next step in the chain is to illegally obtain a title deed for the land and sell it, says Mr Stabile. They then find another patch of forest and start again. The land is often sold to large-scale farmers and it is hard to tell which was cleared legally and what wasn't.

The same happens in Colombia, Peru and Ecuador.

According to Mr Stabile and other investigators, Brazil could double or triple its number of cattle without felling another hectare of the Amazon rainforest.

""What's happening is land speculation,"" he says. ""If the government defined these public areas, it would cease to be lucrative.""

Environmentalists and investigators say statements and policies from Bolsonaro's government are encouraging clearances and the persecution of indigenous people.

Although the government denies this, the president has said he wants to end the ""industry of environmental taxes"" and believes the country has too many conservation areas. The government also wants to allow mining on land belonging to indigenous tribes.

Between January and September 2019, attacks and invasions of indigenous people's land increased 40% on the previous year. The finger of blame is pointed at those involved in land clearance, logging and mining.

However, as the coronavirus crisis took hold in May, around 4,000 troops were mobilised in the Amazon against illegal logging and other activities until June, although that could be extended into the dry season to help with fire prevention.

Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said the coronavirus outbreak had ""aggravated"" the situation this year.

President Bolsonaro, however, has spoken against punitive measures taken against loggers and miners - such as the destruction of their equipment when it can't be taken out of the forest. Critics say that sends a message that the government is on their side.

Colombia Amazon area: 48.5 million hectares Primary forest lost: 11.7%

In 2017, the level of deforestation in Colombia was one of the biggest in the Amazon region and the highest in the country's history. More than 140,000 hectares of forest was cleared, twice the previous year's total.

This peak was a result of the peace accord with Farc rebels in 2016, which left a power vacuum in forested areas.

Community leaders said Farc had acted as a type of environmental police, controlling when farmers were allowed to clear the forest or burn for agriculture or cattle farming.

""Government officials wouldn't come near the Amazon region because of Farc, who, for their own protection, had an interest in keeping the trees standing. So the rebels could establish strict rules,"" said Rodrigo Botero, director of Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development.

However, Colombia is now facing a race to clear land in the Amazon led by large-scale farmers, local authorities, drug dealers and other paramilitary groups such as the ELN, says Botero.

There is a market for land and the government can't stop it, he says.

The Colombian government formed a National Council for the Fight against Deforestation in an attempt to tackle the issue.

The group works to identify pockets of deforestation, the causes and what action is needed, according to the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development.

Laws passed in 2018 made the protection of water, biodiversity and the environment priority issues in matters of national security. The government can now intervene to protect areas in the Amazon national park from illegal activities.

They are also carrying out military operations against people clearing land and launching programmes which promote financial incentives for conservation.

But in 2018, deforestation rates only fell by 4%. By 2018, Colombian had lost around 11.7% of its original forest - 14% of which was in the last eight years.

In the north of Ecuador, palm oil production is the main threat to the Amazon, experts say.

The oil is used worldwide in the industrialised production of food such as chocolate, cosmetics, cleaning products and fuels.

Ecuador is the second biggest producer of palm oil in Latin America, and the sixth worldwide.

The expansion of palm oil and cocoa plantations in the last 10 years is the main driver of deforestation, according to Global Forest Watch and Maap.

This is particularly worrying because despite only covering about 2% of the Amazon biome, Ecuador has one of the most diverse parts of the forest. In just one hectare of the Yasuní park area, you'll find 670 tree species - more than in the whole of North America.

Furthermore, according to a study by the country's National Institute of Biodiversity, between 40% and 60% of the species of trees in Ecuador's Amazon region are still unknown.

Mining boom

Mining projects and oil exploration in the Amazon have also made headline news in Ecuador.

One such project is Mirador, an open mine for copper, gold and silver which will be built in two Amazon provinces. It is the biggest project of its type in Ecuador - but not the only one.

The government says industrial mining in the region, carried out by a Chinese company, will be responsible and the income generated will allow investment in infrastructure locally.

However, investigators believe the activity could bring with it serious problems to the Amazon.

""As well as deforestation, we don't know exactly where they are going to put the dams nor how they are going to monitor them,"" said Carmen Josse, scientific director of the EcoCiencia Foundation.

At the start of 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron suspended a gold mining megaproject within the Guianan Amazon National Park, which he had initially approved at the start of his tenure. The suspension was the result of national and international campaigns.

Despite this, illegal mining is the main threat to the park. Security forces have detected an increase in the number of illegal mines in the area since 2017.

With a population of less than 300,000 people, French Guiana has between 8,000 and 10,000 illegal miners. The rising price of gold since the 2008 financial crisis has sparked a rush to find the metal in the forests of the world.

Part of its success is due to strategies such as the creation of a forest management commission, which decides which trees can or cannot be cut down.

However, legal felling controlled by the government is still considered a factor that enables deforestation. According to environmentalists, licences for large international logging companies create access to virgin forest which illegal miners take advantage of.

Guyana's Forestry Commission says it has not opened any new areas of the forest for legal felling since 2015.

In fact, some areas were taken back off the companies who had licences to exploit them and they have become conservation areas, the government said.

Illegal mining - mainly gold - is to blame for 85% of the forest loss, according to the Forestry Commission. Gold is the country's main export.

The government says it has a ""Green State development strategy"" for the country which includes more investment in ecotourism and renewable energy, stricter limits on CO2 emissions and increasing forest conservation.

All this is funded by international agreements to preserve the Amazon and the discovery of huge oil reserves at sea.

Small scale agriculture has traditionally been the main cause of deforestation in Peru. Recently, however, cultivation of palm oil, cocoa and coca are catching up.

A 2018 study found that despite making up only 4% of crops in the Amazon, palm oil was responsible for 11% of deforestation between 2007 and 2013. The oil is used worldwide to produce food, cosmetics and fuel.

After some palm oil producers were fined for deforestation, they started to buy land from small farmers who had already cleared the forest illegally, says Sandra Rios, geographical engineer with the Instituto de Bien Comun (IBC Peru).

Illegal gold mining poses an increasing risk to the Peruvian Amazon. Peru is the biggest exporter of gold in Latin America, and the sixth worldwide. However, experts say up to 25% of its annual production comes from illegal mining.

Since 2006, Peru has been experiencing a new gold rush in the Tambopata Nature Reserve, one of the most biodiverse in the region, driven by rising gold prices and the construction of the Brazil-Peru Transoceanic Highway.

The road, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic, not only makes travelling easier, it also opens up previously inaccessible areas of the forest. The group of miners in the area, known as the La Pampa, has grown to have more than 5,000 members.

The miners strip the vegetation from the Amazon soil to look for gold. They use mercury to separate the precious metal from others, poisoning the waters and local animals in the process.

In 2017, the loss of forest as a result of mining reached its highest level since 1985, according to the Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation (Cincia).

Venezuela has the sixth largest natural gold reserve in the world, with around 7,000 tonnes.

The mining arc, created in 2016, allowed licences for mining precious metals such as gold, diamonds and coltan (a combination of columbite and tantalite used in the production of mobile phones) across an area of 112,000 sq km, about 12% of the country.

The area also covers natural landmarks, forest reserves, an Amazon national park and at least four designated indigenous territories.

""The Orinoco zone is traditionally a mining area, even the indigenous people did it,"" says ecologist Peláez, from the NGO Provita.

""But the law, in some ways, legalised forms of mining that were already in place and did not help reduce activity. This has had an enormous impact on the environment and the local population.""

Maduro's plan was to grant concessions to foreign mining companies which would have to form businesses together with state-owned companies in order to operate in the area.

In practice, according to Mr Peláez, this resulted in an exponential growth in small-scale mining.

In 2018 alone, according to the Central Bank of Venezuela, the state bought 9.2 tonnes of gold on the internal market - the same as the total amount for 2011-2017.

It's having a devastating effect on the region.

""The gold that is there is of very poor quality, it's dirty,"" says Mr Peláez. ""The amount that is coming out of the ground is very small.""

People are destroying the forest and digging wherever they can. They're leaving sterile sand where nothing can grow. The deforestation in this zone is irreversible Carlos Peláez, Provita

Mining is producing tonnes of sediment that is accumulating in the country's main rivers. The use of mercury to separate gold from impurities, is poisoning rivers and indigenous people.

Venezuela has the most illegal mines in the Amazon, according to a study by Raisg. There are 1,899 illegal mines, concentrated in the Orinoco mining arc.

In the midst of Venezuela's political crisis, the National Assembly tried to repeal the law that created the Orinoco Mining Arc and even labelled it ""ecocide"" or a crime against the environment.

We've asked three government ministries about the strategy to reduce deforestation in the zone, but none have responded.","In the last 10 years, figures for primary forest loss have remained high or spiked in most of the Amazon nations.

Protesters have clashed with police in cities across the US over the killing of an unarmed African-American man at the hands of officers in Minneapolis.

Minnesota's governor said the tragedy of the death of George Floyd in police custody had morphed into ""something much different - wanton destruction"".

New York, Atlanta and other regions have seen violent unrest, while the White House was briefly locked down.

An ex-Minneapolis policeman has been charged with murder over the death.

Derek Chauvin, who is white, was shown in footage kneeling on 46-year-old Mr Floyd's neck on Monday. He and three other officers have since been sacked.

Mr Chauvin, 44, is due to appear in court in Minneapolis for the first time on Monday.

President Donald Trump has described the incident as ""a terrible, terrible thing"" and said he had spoken with Mr Floyd's family, whom he described as ""terrific people"".

The Floyd case has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans.

It follows the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and others, which have all occurred since the Black Lives Matter movement was sparked by the acquittal of neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in 2012.

What's the latest on the protests?

Minnesota remains the most volatile region, with curfews ordered for the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-Saint Paul from 20:00 to 06:00 on Friday and Saturday evening.

Protesters defied the curfew on Friday. Fires, many from burning cars, were visible in a number of areas with fire officials unable to reach some sites.

Television pictures also showed looting in Minneapolis, with police officers thin on the ground.

Only at about midnight (05:00 GMT) did police and National Guard troops move in in any numbers, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports.

State Governor Tim Walz, in an early morning press briefing, described the situation as ""chaotic, dangerous and unprecedented"".

He said the Guard deployment was the largest in state history but admitted ""there's simply more of them than us"". He said those on the streets ""don't give one damn"" about the stay-at-home order.

The Pentagon has put the military on alert for possible deployment in Minneapolis.

On Friday evening, crowds gathered near the White House in Washington waving photographs of Mr Floyd and chanting ""I can't breathe"" - invoking his last words and those of Eric Garner, a black man who died after being held in a police chokehold in New York in 2014.

The White House was then temporarily placed on lockdown, with the US Secret Service closing entrances and exits.

In Atlanta, a state of emergency was declared for some areas to protect people and property. Buildings were vandalised and a police vehicle was set alight as protesters gathered near the offices of news broadcaster CNN.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued a passionate plea, saying: ""This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. You are disgracing our city. You are disgracing the life of George Floyd.""

In New York's Brooklyn district, protesters clashed with police, throwing projectiles, starting fires and destroying police vehicles. A number of officers were injured and many arrests made.

Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: ""We don't ever want to see another night like this.""

In Dallas, officers launched tear gas canisters after they were pelted with stones.

Protesters blocked roads in Los Angeles and also in Oakland, where windows were smashed and ""Kill Cops"" graffiti sprayed.

What are the legal moves so far?

Mr Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter over his role in Mr Floyd's death.

Mr Floyd's family and their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that this was ""welcome but overdue"".

The family said they wanted a more serious, first-degree murder charge as well as the arrest of the three other officers involved.

Hennepin County Prosecutor Mike Freeman said he ""anticipates charges"" for the other officers but would not offer more details.

Mr Freeman said his office ""charged this case as quickly as evidence has been presented to us"".

""This is by far the fastest that we've ever charged a police officer,"" he noted.

According to the criminal complaint, Mr Chauvin acted with ""a depraved mind, without regard for human life"".

How did George Floyd die?

The full report by the county medical examiner has not been released, but the complaint states that the post-mortem examination did not find evidence of ""traumatic asphyxia or strangulation"".

The medical examiner noted Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and the combination of these, ""potential intoxicants in his system"" and being restrained by the officers ""likely contributed to his death"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Demonstrations and protests have continued since Mr Floyd's death in police custody on Monday

The report says Mr Chauvin had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive.

Nearly two minutes before he removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance and pronounced dead around an hour later.

The Minnesota police handbook states that officers trained on how to compress a detainee's neck without applying direct pressure to the airway can use a knee under its use-of-force policy. This is regarded as a non-deadly-force option.

What has the president said?

At the White House on Friday, Mr Trump said he had asked the justice department to expedite an investigation it announced on Friday into whether any civil rights laws were violated in Mr Floyd's death.

The president also said ""looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters"".

Image copyright EPA Image caption People gather outside the White House chanting ""I can't breathe"" and ""Stop killing us""

Earlier, he described the rioters as ""thugs"" who were dishonouring Mr Floyd's memory.

Social media network Twitter accused Mr Trump of glorifying violence in a post that said: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts.""

What happened in the arrest?

Officers suspected Mr Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 note and were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic.

According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed.

129,China-India border: Why tensions are rising between the neighbours,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-52852509,"['Anbarasan Ethirajan', 'Vikas Pandey', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Press Information Bureau Image caption The area has become a hotspot in part because of a road India has built

The armies of the world's two most populous nations are locked in a tense face-off high in the Himalayas, which has the potential to escalate as they seek to further their strategic goals.

Officials quoted by the Indian media say thousands of Chinese troops have forced their way into the Galwan valley in Ladakh, in the disputed Kashmir region.

Indian leaders and military strategists have clearly been left stunned.

The reports say that in early May, Chinese forces put up tents, dug trenches and moved heavy equipment several kilometres inside what had been regarded by India as its territory. The move came after India built a road several hundred kilometres long connecting to a high-altitude forward air base which it reactivated in 2008.

The message from China appears clear to observers in Delhi - this is not a routine incursion.

""The situation is serious. The Chinese have come into territory which they themselves accepted as part of India. It has completely changed the status quo,"" says Ajai Shukla, an Indian military expert who served as a colonel in the army.

China takes a different view, saying it's India which has changed facts on the ground.

Reports in the Indian media said soldiers from the two sides clashed on at least two occasions in Ladakh. Stand-offs are reported in at least three locations: the Galwan valley; Hot Springs; and Pangong lake to the south.

India and China share a border more than 3,440km (2,100 miles) long and have overlapping territorial claims. Their border patrols often bump into each other, resulting in occasional scuffles but both sides insist no bullet has been fired in four decades.

Their armies - two of the world's largest - come face to face at many points. The poorly demarcated Line of Actual Control (LAC) separates the two sides. Rivers, lakes and snowcaps mean the line separating soldiers can shift and they often come close to confrontation.

The current military tension is not limited to Ladakh. Soldiers from the two sides are also eyeball-to-eyeball in Naku La, on the border between China and the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim. Earlier this month they reportedly came to blows.

And there's a row over a new map put out by Nepal, too, which accuses India of encroaching on its territory by building a road connecting with China.

Why are tensions rising now?

There are several reasons - but competing strategic goals lie at the root, and both sides blame each other.

""The traditionally peaceful Galwan River has now become a hotspot because it is where the LAC is closest to the new road India has built along the Shyok River to Daulet Beg Oldi (DBO) - the most remote and vulnerable area along the LAC in Ladakh,"" Mr Shukla says.

India's decision to ramp up infrastructure seems to have infuriated Beijing.

Image copyright AFP Image caption There have been protests in Nepal against Indi's new road link

Chinese state-run media outlet Global Times said categorically: ""The Galwan Valley region is Chinese territory, and the local border control situation was very clear.""

""According to the Chinese military, India is the one which has forced its way into the Galwan valley. So, India is changing the status quo along the LAC - that has angered the Chinese,"" says Dr Long Xingchun, president of the Chengdu Institute of World Affairs (CIWA), a think tank.

Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia programme at the Wilson Center, another think tank, says this face-off is not routine. He adds China's ""massive deployment of soldiers is a show of strength"".

The road could boost Delhi's capability to move men and material rapidly in case of a conflict.

Differences have been growing in the past year over other areas of policy too.

When India controversially decided to end Jammu and Kashmir's limited autonomy in August last year, it also redrew the region's map.

The new federally-administered Ladakh included Aksai Chin, an area India claims but China controls.

Senior leaders of India's Hindu-nationalist BJP government have also been talking about recapturing Pakistan-administered Kashmir. A strategic road, the Karakoram highway, passes through this area that connects China with its long-term ally Pakistan. Beijing has invested about $60bn (£48bn) in Pakistan's infrastructure - the so-called China Pakistan Economic corridor (CPEC) - as part of its Belt and Road Initiative and the highway is key to transporting goods to and from the southern Pakistani port of Gwadar. The port gives China a foothold in the Arabian Sea.

In addition, China was unhappy when India initially banned all exports of medical and protective equipment to shore up its stocks soon after the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year.

How dangerous could this get?

""We routinely see both armies crossing the LAC - it's fairly common and such incidents are resolved at the local military level. But this time, the build-up is the largest we have ever seen,"" says former Indian diplomat P Stobdan, an expert in Ladakh and India-China affairs.

""The stand-off is happening at some strategic areas that are important for India. If Pangong lake is taken, Ladakh can't be defended. If the Chinese military is allowed to settle in the strategic valley of Shyok, then the Nubra valley and even Siachen can be reached.""

In what seems to be an intelligence failure, India seems to have been caught off guard again. According to Indian media accounts, the country's soldiers were outnumbered and surrounded when China swiftly diverted men and machines from a military exercise to the border region.

This triggered alarm in Delhi - and India has limited room for manoeuvre. It can either seek to persuade Beijing to withdraw its troops through dialogue or try to remove them by force. Neither is an easy option.

""China is the world's second-largest military power. Technologically it's superior to India. Infrastructure on the other side is very advanced. Financially, China can divert its resources to achieve its military goals, whereas the Indian economy has been struggling in recent years, and the coronavirus crisis has worsened the situation,"" says Ajai Shukla.

What next?

History holds difficult lessons for India. It suffered a humiliating defeat during the 1962 border conflict with China. India says China occupies 38,000km of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary issues.

China already controls the Aksai Chin area further east of Ladakh and this region, claimed by India, is strategically important for Beijing as it connect its Xinjiang province with western Tibet.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption India and China have a long history of border disputes

In 2017 India and China were engaged in a similar stand-off lasting more than two months in Doklam plateau, a tri-junction between India, China and Bhutan.

India objected to China building a road in a region claimed by Bhutan. The Chinese stood firm. Within six months, Indian media reported that Beijing had built a permanent all-weather military complex there.

This time, too, talks are seen as the only way forward - both countries have so much to lose in a military conflict.

""China has no intention to escalate tensions and I think India also doesn't want a conflict. But the situation depends on both sides. The Indian government should not be guided by the nationalistic media comments,"" says Dr Long Xingchun of the CIWA in Chengdu. ""Both countries have the ability to solve the dispute through high-level talks.""

Chinese media have given hardly any coverage to the border issue, which is being interpreted as a possible signal that a route to talks will be sought.

Pratyush Rao, associate director for South Asia at Control Risks consultancy, says both sides have ""a clear interest in prioritising their economic recovery"" and avoiding military escalation.

""It is important to recognise that both sides have a creditable record of maintaining relative peace and stability along their disputed border.""","It has completely changed the status quo,"" says Ajai Shukla, an Indian military expert who served as a colonel in the army.
Reports in the Indian media said soldiers from the two sides clashed on at least two occasions in Ladakh.

Viewpoint: Frightening words

By Barrett Holmes Pitner

In saying ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"", President Donald Trump echoed a December 1967 quote from Miami Police Chief Walter Headley.

It was used as a threat towards African Americans in Miami and as part of his brutal ""get tough policy"" where he advocated the use of guns and dogs to stop civil rights protests.

In August of 1968, as Richard Nixon addressed the Republican National Convention in Miami, the police there killed three protesters, injured 18, and arrested over 200 people. Similar violent police attacks defined America during the 1960s, as African Americans fought for civil rights and voting rights. It is not a widely known phrase, but Headley's sentiments have long been part of the American status quo - US law enforcement and political figures have made many statements invoking Headley and they still do today. It's frightening to now hear Headley's words emanate from the highest reaches of our government.

Here are three things you need to know from the UK:

1. Scientific advisers to the government have warned of the risk of lifting lockdown in England.

Prof John Edmunds from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine said the levels of the coronavirus were still ""very high"" and it was a ""political decision"" to ease measures. And Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, warned that the virus was “spreading too fast to lift lockdown” and that the NHS test and trace system should be ""fully working"" first.

2. Some extremely vulnerable people have been told they have been removed from shielding lists via text message, without the knowledge of their GP.

Around 2.2 million people in the UK are shielding – but healthcare charities say the lack of a clear plan for their future is causing anxiety and potentially putting their health at risk. Some people have received text messages removing them from official lists with no explanation, while charities say others have been asked to shield for longer - until the end of June.

3. And new research suggests private renters are more likely to be struggling with payments than those who own their homes.

President Donald Trump has announced that he will start to end preferential treatment for Hong Kong in trade and travel, in response to a new security law pushed by Beijing.

He described the Chinese government's moves to introduce the measure in Hong Kong as a ""tragedy"".

Mr Trump also said he was ""terminating"" the US relationship with the World Health Organization over Covid-19.

China has told the West to ""stop interfering"" in Hong Kong.

The territory, a former British colony, enjoys unique freedoms not seen in mainland China. But many people there see the looming security law as bringing an end to Hong Kong's special status, agreed under a 1984 agreement between China and the UK.

There are fears the proposed measure - which has sparked a wave of anti-mainland protests - could end Hong Kong's unique status and make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory.

This week, Britain said that if China went forward with the law, it could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to UK citizenship.

On Friday, the UK Home Office confirmed that up to three million people with BNO status could acquire citizenship in this way - as long as they applied for and were granted a passport.

What did President Trump outline?

Mr Trump said that he no longer considered Hong Kong to be separate from China.

""China has replaced One Country, Two Systems with One Country, One System"", Mr Trump told reporters in the White House's Rose Garden, in a prepared statement that attacked China on several fronts.

""This is a tragedy for Hong Kong... China has smothered Hong Kong's freedom,"" he said.

Mr Trump said sanctions would be imposed on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who were believed by Washington to be involved in eroding the territory's autonomy. He did not outline what form these sanctions would take.

He added that the State Department would revise its travel advisory for Hong Kong in light of ""increased danger of surveillance"" from China.

The president also said the US would suspend the entry of foreign nationals from China identified by the US as potential security risks. There are fears that this could affect thousands of graduate students.

No further details were given on Mr Trump's announcement that he would ""terminate"" the US relationship with the WHO. In April, the US president said he would halt funding to the UN agency because it has ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak.

He accused the WHO of mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China.

The Global Times newspaper - whose views are believed to reflect those of China's leaders- called the move towards revoking Hong Kong's special status with the US ""recklessly arbitrary"".

Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng told the BBC's Chinese Service earlier on Friday that any threat of sanctions was unacceptable.

""Are the sanctions being imposed with a view to coerce another state to change their policy...? Any such sanctions are not going to benefit anyone,"" she said.

Adding a new edge to the deteriorating US-China relations

Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese

The US removing Hong Kong's special privileges sent a strong warning signal to China, which activists and protesters in the territory will welcome.

The announced measures include not only Hong Kong, but also intellectual property theft and Chinese firms listed in the US.

According to media reports, Washington is expected to revoke more than 3,000 Chinese graduate students' visas. While this accounts for only 1% of the total number of Chinese students in America, Washington's move will open yet another front of the bilateral tensions.

But the separate punishments announced for China may not be as harsh as what had been expected, as indicated in the stock markets' rise after his speech.

Beijing will probably match some of Washington's sanctions and restrictions in a tit-for-tat manner. After a short-lived honeymoon since the trade deal, China and the US appear to be heading towards the abyss at an accelerating speed.

What is the security law about?

China has proposed security legislation which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong, and could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time.

China's parliament has backed the resolution - which now passes to the country's senior leadership.

Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September.

Image copyright AFP Image caption President Xi Jinping and other senior figures applauded when the security law was passed

However, it is expected to criminalise:

secession - breaking away from China

subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government

terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people

activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong

Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform.

Forbes magazine has struck reality TV star and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner from its list of billionaires, and accused her family of inflating the value of her cosmetics business.

Forbes said the family went to ""unusual lengths"" to present its youngest member as richer than she was.

In tweets, Jenner dismissed the article as ""inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol"".

""I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there,"" she wrote.

""I can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money I have,"" she added.

The move reverses the status Forbes conferred on Jenner in 2019, when it declared her a self-made billionaire.

The description sparked controversy, with critics scoffing at the ""self-made"" title and pointing to her upbringing as a Kardashian family reality TV star.

Forbes, which is known for its widely cited billionaire rankings, credited Jenner's status to the success of her cosmetics company, which she founded in 2015 and which includes Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin.

Jenner last year announced she was selling a 51% stake in the company to beauty giant Coty for $600m.

Forbes said the family's accountant had provided it with tax returns that suggested the firm had done more than $300m in sales in 2016 and that publicists claimed sales of $330m the following year.

But information shared by Coty, which is publicly traded, showed Jenner's firm is ""significantly smaller and less profitable than the family has spent years leading the cosmetics industry and media outlets, including Forbes, to believe"", Forbes said.

Coty's presentation to investors about the business suggested the firm did only $125m in sales in 2018.

""If Kylie Cosmetics did $125 million in sales in 2018, how could it have done $307 million in 2016 (as the company's supposed tax returns state) or $330 million in 2017?"" Forbes asked in the article.

Despite the magazine's downgrade, Jenner is hardly hurting.

Forbes said she pocketed $340m from the sale of her business. It now estimates her net worth at ""just under $900m"".

Forbes writers have previously accused other would-be billionaires of inflating their riches, including US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and President Donald Trump.","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In 2019, Forbes declared Kylie Jenner a self-made billionaireForbes magazine has struck reality TV star and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner from its list of billionaires, and accused her family of inflating the value of her cosmetics business.

In a sex fantasy gone wrong, two men with machetes entered the wrong house in New South Wales, Australia, before quickly realising their error.

One of them has now been acquitted of entering a home armed with a weapon in July 2019, Australian media report.

They had been hired to carry out a client's fantasy of being tied up in his underwear and stroked with a broom.

The judge concluded that ""the facts of the case are unusual"".

The role play was arranged over Facebook by a man near Griffith, New South Wales, who provided his address to the hired pair.

""He was willing to pay A$5,000 if it was 'really good',"" the judge said.

However, the client moved to another address 50km (30 miles) away without updating the two men. They then entered a home on the street of the original address.

When the resident noticed a light on in his kitchen at 06:15, he assumed it was a friend who came by daily to make morning coffee.

When the men called out the name of their client, the resident turned on the light and removed a sleep apnoea mask he was wearing.

It was then that he saw them standing above his bed with the machetes, which they appeared to have brought as props for the role play.

When they realised their error, one of the pair said, ""Sorry, mate"", and shook the resident's hand, according to local reports.

The two men then drove to the correct address, where the client noticed one man had a ""great big knife"" in his trousers and asked them to leave the weapons in their car.

The client then cooked bacon, eggs and noodles, and a short time later, the police arrived at the property, found the machetes in the car and arrested the hired pair.

The judge ruled that evidence did not suggest the men's actions were intentional.

""They carried the machetes either as a prop or something to use in that fantasy,"" he said. ""The fantasy was unscripted and there was discretion as to how it would be carried out.""

135,Coronavirus: Trump terminates US relationship with WHO,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52857413,[],"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump has accused the WHO of failing to hold Beijing to account

US President Donald Trump has announced that he is terminating the country's relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO).

The president has accused the WHO of failing to hold Beijing to account over the coronavirus pandemic.

""China has total control over the World Health Organization,"" the president said while announcing measures aimed at punishing Beijing.

Washington will redirect funds to other bodies, he said.

The US is the global health agency's largest single contributor, providing more than $400m (£324m; €360m) in 2019.

Mr Trump, who is campaigning for re-election this year and has been criticised for his own handling of the pandemic, has blamed China for trying to cover up the coronavirus outbreak.

More than 102,000 people in the US have lost their lives to Covid-19 - by far the biggest death toll in the world.

What did Trump say?

""We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and directing those funds"" to other global public health charities, Mr Trump said in the White House Rose Garden.

""The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,"" he said.

He added that China had ""instigated a global pandemic that has cost over 100,000 American lives"".

The president accused China of pressurising the WHO to ""mislead the world"" about the virus.

What's the background to this?

Mr Trump's criticism of the WHO's handling of the pandemic began last month when he threatened to permanently withdraw US funding, suggesting the UN health agency had ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response.

""It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organisation in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world,"" he wrote in a letter to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on 18 May.

He later labelled the WHO a ""puppet of China"".

136,SpaceX launch: Nasa astronauts set for second try,https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-52855029,"['Jonathan Amos', 'Bbc Science Correspondent']","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bad weather conditions delayed Wednesday's launch attempt

Rocket company SpaceX will make a second attempt in the coming hours to get Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit.

Their flight to the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday was postponed because of poor weather at Florida's Kennedy Space Center.

Saturday's forecast is not brilliant. The meteorologists say conditions will probably be touch and go again.

The lift-off is scheduled for 15:22 EDT (19:22 GMT; 20:22 BST).

There's huge focus on Hurley's and Behnken's mission because it will mark the first time that the United States has been able to launch its astronauts to the ISS since the retirement of Nasa's space shuttles in 2011.

It will also be the first occasion that the US space agency has used a private company to transport one of its crews to orbit.

But people were wrong if they thought this attention added to the pressure to get the astronauts off the ground, said Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.

""We will launch when we are ready,"" he told reporters. ""I'll tell you, the President (Donald Trump) and the Vice President (Mike Pence) were proud of the Nasa team and the SpaceX team for making the right call for the right reasons (on Wednesday).""

For skywatchers in the UK, the Saturday flight is less favourable for catching sight of the capsule coming overhead. The first pass following lift-off comes when conditions are too light (just after 20:40 BST). The second pass, at around 22:15 BST, is better, but the vehicle will be very low on the horizon in the southwest.

Image copyright NASA Image caption Saturday will run through the same routines

The first launch attempt in the week was scrubbed just 16 minutes before the designated launch time. There had been much electrical activity in the air throughout the day, and controllers concluded it wouldn't be prudent to proceed with the flight.

At the moment of postponement, Hurley and Behnken were sitting in their Dragon capsule atop its Falcon rocket with the booster fuels being loaded below them.

The frustration was that the countdown was going so smoothly; engineers had seen no technical issues of concern. The vehicles were in perfect shape to begin their ascent.

Saturday will follow exactly the same routines. The astronauts will head out to the pad about three hours prior to 15:22 EDT. A SpaceX ""close out"" team will help them strap into their capsule seats, and then it will be a case of running through the pre-flight checks with controllers.

Image copyright NASA Image caption Wednesday's countdown was very smooth, with no technical issues of concern

Nasa astronaut Nicole Mann said her colleagues were unflustered by the potential for further delay.

""There are plenty of things in life you can't control, the weather being one of them,"" she said. ""You need just to remain flexible, not to waste any energy on those things you can't control. And then do what you need to do: prepare, and then when it's time for the next launch opportunity, you know you're ready to go.""

If the launch goes ahead, Hurley and Behnken have about a 19-hour flight to the ISS. They'll use that time to try out systems onboard the Dragon capsule, including having a go at manual flying. They'll also need to get some sleep after what will have been a long day.

The duo are expected to stay at the ISS for between one and four months before returning to Earth.

SpaceX, which is run by the tech billionaire Elon Musk, has a $2.6bn contract with Nasa to provide six crew flights to the space station. The first of these is scheduled for the end of August, assuming nothing untoward happens on Hurley's and Behnken's demonstration.

The Boeing company has a similar contract, but it is a year at least behind SpaceX in its development timeline.

A CNN reporter has been released after being arrested while covering protests in Minneapolis over the death of an unarmed black man.

Omar Jimenez was led away in handcuffs while he was live on air early on Friday. His cameraman and producer were also detained, apparently because they did not move on when told.

They were released without charge.

Minnesota governor Tim Walz has apologised, describing the incident as ""unacceptable"".

CNN said the arrests violated the constitution.

What happened?

Mr Jimenez was in Minneapolis, reporting on a third night of violent protests over the death of George Floyd. On Tuesday a video emerged, showing a police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, despite him saying he could not breathe.

Mr Jimenez was reporting live on an arrest happening in the area where a police station was burnt out.

After the crew caught the arrest on camera, police officers started moving towards them and instructed them to move.

On the video, Mr Jimenez identifies himself as a CNN journalist and can be heard telling the officers: ""We can move back to where you'd like here. We are live on the air at the moment.""

An officer in riot gear then says, ""You are under arrest"" and leads him away in handcuffs.

What has the reaction been?

CNN called the arrests a ""clear violation of their First Amendment rights"" in a tweet. The First Amendment to the US constitution protects freedom of speech and of association.

Norway and Denmark say they will open up tourism between their two countries from 15 June, but will maintain restrictions for Swedes.

Sweden, unlike its Nordic neighbours, did not impose a lockdown and more than 4,000 people have died from Covid-19 there - far more than elsewhere in Scandinavia.

Sweden's 10 million population is also bigger than that of Denmark (5.8 million) or Norway (5.4 million).

Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen argued that Denmark and Sweden were in different places concerning the coronavirus pandemic.

But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?”

The pricing equation

Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.”

This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.”

The art, meanwhile, comes from “the airline’s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That’s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,” Cany concludes.

But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving.

When will demand return?

In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.","Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends.

But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving.

When will demand return?

In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.","Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends.
This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket.
The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.”This is both a science and an art.

195,The surprising perks of isolated work,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200527-the-surprising-perks-of-isolated-work,['Norman Miller'],"For millions of people worldwide, widespread lockdown has cast isolation as a negative – a loss of group engagement and communal hubbub. Yet while many of us are clamouring to get back into the social rhythm of the office, there are people around the world who choose work lives involving long periods isolated in remote settings.

“Some people thrive on their own company,” says Sandi Mann, senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire. “It gives the freedom of not having to worry about other people in terms of their needs or judgements. Others might like the challenge to see if they can cope on their own or to help them adjust to a different pace of life.”

Mann sees solitary times as beneficial contrasts to the pace of modern living. “We get used to high levels of dopamine from a busy, hectic and stimulation-rich environment, but dopamine is addictive. So, to wean ourselves off we need lower levels of stimulation.”

Or perhaps, rather than thinking in terms of lower levels of stimulation, those who choose to spend time out in the world in solitary are actually discovering different kinds of stimulation that crowded lives cover up.

BBC Worklife talked to some of these workers out on their own and asked why they like their isolated jobs. For them, being alone need not mean being lonely – even in the remotest of places.

201,Why we’ve created new language for coronavirus,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200522-why-weve-created-new-language-for-coronavirus,['Christine Ro'],"Throughout history, challenging circumstances have given rise to new ways of expressing those challenges. George Eliot, the 19th Century writer who was famously frustrated by rigid gender and lifestyle norms, is credited with the first recorded use of the word ‘frustrating’. More recently, Brexit led to a flowering of new words, including the inevitable ‘Bremain’ and ‘Bregret’, and a repurposing of existing words, such as ‘backstop’.

While Brexit may be the closest parallel, the speed of the linguistic change we’re seeing with Covid-19 is unprecedented, says Robert Lawson, a sociolinguist at Birmingham City University. Lawson attributes this to multiple factors: the dizzying pace at which the virus has spread, its dominance in the media and global interconnectivity at a time when social media and remote contact are so important.

Many of the newly popular terms relate to the socially distanced nature of human contact these days, such as ‘virtual happy hour’, ‘covideo party’ and ‘quarantine and chill’. Many use ‘corona’ as a prefix, whether Polish speakers convert ‘coronavirus’ into a verb or English speakers wonder how ‘coronababies’ (the children born or conceived during the pandemic) will fare. And, of course, there are abbreviations, like the ubiquitous ‘WFH’ and the life-saving ‘PPE’.

Old words in a new light

Like everyone else, lexicologists are scrambling to keep up with the changes the pandemic has wrought. According to Fiona McPherson, the senior editor of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), back in December ‘coronavirus’ appeared only 0.03 times per million tokens (tokens are the smallest units of language collected and tracked in the OED corpus).

205,Why flats dominate Spain’s housing market,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200506-why-do-flats-dominate-spains-housing-market,['Jessica Jones'],"Own your home

Spain may be a nation of flat-dwellers, but it is also traditionally a nation of homeowners. It’s another reason why flats – that were generally cheaper to buy – became so popular. According to Eurostat figures, 76% of Spaniards owned their own home in 2018, compared to 65% of French and British people and 52% of Germans.

New rental laws and economic conditions during the 1960s meant that for the first time many Spaniards’ main goal was to own property, something encouraged by Franco, whose regime attached great importance to the home as the heart of Catholic society. “The apartment responded well to the double need to offer many housing units – in a short time and at a reduced price – and to the desire that it be owned,” says Román. “In Spain at that time, owning property became one of the main symbols of prosperity.”

New-build apartments held lavish inauguration events that included key handover ceremonies and the blessing of the new homes by a priest – acts that, says Román, were “conveniently publicised by the dictatorship’s propaganda machine”. Partly because of the government messaging, for many poor families owning a property “constituted one of life’s main aspirations”, she says.

It also made sense in a country where an inflationary economy meant most people put their money into bricks and mortar. “Financial markets were not very developed and there was a lot of inflation that would eat away at your savings. The best way to preserve their value was real estate,” adds economist Díaz Giménez.

‘Intense feeling of community’

The root of apartment living may be economic, but is there a case to be made that Spaniards just like living shoulder-to-shoulder? For many, growing up surrounded by neighbours has fostered a thriving sense of community.

Marc Pradel, 40, an expert on urban sociology at the University of Barcelona, says the dominance of apartments has “generated strong and vibrant neighbourhoods in most Spanish cities, which has reinforced local social life”. In fact, these neighbourhoods and the allure of living in the heart of the town or city is what attracts many people to live in flats.","Own your homeSpain may be a nation of flat-dwellers, but it is also traditionally a nation of homeowners.

For others – well, the transition isn’t quite as seamless. Some find all they’ve done with their eight hours is answer two emails, dream about a massage or discover their ‘cheese hour’.

It’s true: some people simply have dispositions and personality traits that enable them to better adjust to the new world of remote work than others. However, it’s not so black and white. You’re not necessarily destined to be good or bad at working remotely – some may just have to put in more effort than others.

The pull of procrastination

Procrastination is never easier than when your superior isn’t looking over your shoulder. As long as the status light on your communication app is green, it’s easy to pop into the kitchen and try a new recipe, or get into a YouTube hole, with no one any the wiser.

If it feels easier to procrastinate at home than in the office, it is for most: telework is a “weak situation” with murkier expectations about behaviour, says Timothy Pychyl, associate psychology professor at Carleton University in Ontario. In contrast, he points to a common situation: “In an elevator, we all typically ‘act elevator’, for example avoid eye contact with others, and keep our distance as [much as] possible …. The office is more of a strong situation with expectations for many things such as dress codes, arrival and departure times [and] time spent on or off task.” Weaker cues and lower accountability may make procrastination more likely at home.

And without the strong situation of an office, it’s quite a bit easier to dismiss unpleasant tasks. When there’s a task on your plate you don’t want to dive into, or you’re banging your head against a wall with a tech problem, you’re testing your ‘frustration tolerance’, says Pychyl. Those who have a lower frustration tolerance are much more likely to procrastinate – they’re the people who get up from their desk and find a distraction.","For some, working from home is a gift – a remarkable opportunity to focus and be hyper-productive, all the while finding time to walk the dog and even exercise in pyjamas.

209,Coronavirus: How much news is too much?,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200505-coronavirus-how-much-news-is-too-much,['Maddy Savage'],"“Anxiety looks at the possible and focuses on that and amplifies that, rather than the probable,” explains Davies. For example, those who are prone to anxiety might read an article to source factual information about the economy, then “go down a rabbit hole” and focus on the worst-case scenario for their own income prospects. “They're saying, ‘well, you know, my job is at risk, I'm going to lose my job and then I can't support myself and then I will lose my house’,” explains Davies.

Others with anxiety may be more susceptible to feeling the pain felt by those who’ve lost lives or loved ones in the crisis. “Our imagination and memory leaves us afterwards rehearsing things in our heads... We imagine what scenes are like for people, how terrible that might be, and those types of things are distressing for people.”

Switching off the news might, however, not be so easy for this group, because “the thing about anxiety for people generally is that it pushes us to check [the information], to try and relieve anxiety”.

For those with depression, the opposite may be true. Davies says some people “switch off and become apathetic” after being exposed to too much coronavirus information, and instead turn to alternative and potentially dangerous sources of stimulation, such as too much alcohol or food.

When you can’t switch off

There’s also a sizable minority who are finding themselves consumed by the news cycle more than usual for professional reasons. Journalists, communications professionals, government officials, doctors, scientists and, most recently, disinfectant manufacturers are among those having to stay on top of daily comments, trends and data in a way they’ve never previously experienced. For many, this is happening while they are working from home and managing blurred boundaries between their work and private lives.

“I'm a journalist with a toddler, a new puppy and a tween...and I've been having a hard time sleeping because of media overload, yet I can't logically escape this as I work in journalism,” says Lorraine Allen Derosa, a freelance journalist in Spain who has been covering the pandemic for US media. This involves working late at night partly because of the time difference. “It's also the only time I can work because we have no childcare at the moment,” she admits.

Therapist John-Paul Davies says a number of his current clients (who he now sees digitally) are those who “suddenly have to be on top of the latest developments” or are spending a lot of time speaking to those who’ve been hit hardest by the coronavirus.

“Hearing those stories, you're bound to be affected by them, you know, particularly if you care about other people, and [for] a lot of journalists that’s the reason for doing it. They're interested in other people's stories.”","“Anxiety looks at the possible and focuses on that and amplifies that, rather than the probable,” explains Davies.

211,Coronavirus: How much news is too much?,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200505-coronavirus-how-much-news-is-too-much,['Maddy Savage'],"“Anxiety looks at the possible and focuses on that and amplifies that, rather than the probable,” explains Davies. For example, those who are prone to anxiety might read an article to source factual information about the economy, then “go down a rabbit hole” and focus on the worst-case scenario for their own income prospects. “They're saying, ‘well, you know, my job is at risk, I'm going to lose my job and then I can't support myself and then I will lose my house’,” explains Davies.

Others with anxiety may be more susceptible to feeling the pain felt by those who’ve lost lives or loved ones in the crisis. “Our imagination and memory leaves us afterwards rehearsing things in our heads... We imagine what scenes are like for people, how terrible that might be, and those types of things are distressing for people.”

Switching off the news might, however, not be so easy for this group, because “the thing about anxiety for people generally is that it pushes us to check [the information], to try and relieve anxiety”.

For those with depression, the opposite may be true. Davies says some people “switch off and become apathetic” after being exposed to too much coronavirus information, and instead turn to alternative and potentially dangerous sources of stimulation, such as too much alcohol or food.

When you can’t switch off

There’s also a sizable minority who are finding themselves consumed by the news cycle more than usual for professional reasons. Journalists, communications professionals, government officials, doctors, scientists and, most recently, disinfectant manufacturers are among those having to stay on top of daily comments, trends and data in a way they’ve never previously experienced. For many, this is happening while they are working from home and managing blurred boundaries between their work and private lives.

“I'm a journalist with a toddler, a new puppy and a tween...and I've been having a hard time sleeping because of media overload, yet I can't logically escape this as I work in journalism,” says Lorraine Allen Derosa, a freelance journalist in Spain who has been covering the pandemic for US media. This involves working late at night partly because of the time difference. “It's also the only time I can work because we have no childcare at the moment,” she admits.

Therapist John-Paul Davies says a number of his current clients (who he now sees digitally) are those who “suddenly have to be on top of the latest developments” or are spending a lot of time speaking to those who’ve been hit hardest by the coronavirus.

“Hearing those stories, you're bound to be affected by them, you know, particularly if you care about other people, and [for] a lot of journalists that’s the reason for doing it. They're interested in other people's stories.”","“Anxiety looks at the possible and focuses on that and amplifies that, rather than the probable,” explains Davies.

227,The tree that changed the world map,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200527-the-tree-that-changed-the-world-map,['Vittoria Traverso'],"Unfurling in a carpet of green where the Andes and Amazon basin meet in south-western Peru, Manú National Park is one of the most biodiverse corners of the planet: a lush, 1.5-million hectare Unesco-inscribed nature reserve wrapped in mist, covered in a chaos of vines and largely untouched by humans.

Where to see the rare cinchona tree Manú National Park, Peru: A haven of biodiversity, the Unesco nature preserve is home to an estimated 5,000 plant species. Podocarpus National Park, Ecuador: One of the last places to spot Ecuador’s national tree. Hiking through its misty trails, you may also encounter the spectacled bear, one of the Andes’ most emblematic animals. Cutervo National Park, Peru: Peru’s oldest protected area is famous for its pre-Columbian archaeological remains, 88 species of orchids and for being the last remaining cloud forest in the Peruvian highlands. Semilla Bendita Botanical Garden, Peru: This botanical garden operated by local environmentalists is home to more than 1,300 native species – including orchids and cinchonas.

But if you hack your way through the rainforest’s dense jungle, cross its rushing rivers and avoid the jaguars and pumas, you may see one of the few remaining specimens of the endangered cinchona officinalis tree. To the untrained eye, the thin, 15m-tall tree may blend into the thicketed maze. But the flowering plant, which is native to the Andean foothills, has inspired many myths and shaped human history for centuries.

“This may not be a well-known tree,” said Nataly Canales, who grew up in the Peruvian Amazonian region of Madre de Dios. “Yet, a compound extracted from this plant has saved millions of lives in human history.”

Today, Canales is a biologist at the National Museum of Denmark who is tracing the genetic history of cinchona. As she explained, it was the bark of this rare tree that gave the world quinine, the world’s first anti-malarial drug. And while the discovery of quinine was welcomed by the world with both excitement and suspicion hundreds of years ago, in recent weeks, this tree’s medical derivatives have been at the centre of another heated global debate. Synthetic versions of quinine – such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – have been touted and largely disputed as possible treatments for the novel coronavirus.

For centuries, malaria, a disease caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, has plagued people across the world. It ravaged the Roman Empire; it killed between 150 to 300 million people in the 20th Century; and, according to the World Health Organization, nearly half of the world’s population still lives in areas where the disease is transmitted.

Medieval remedies to cure “mal aria” (“bad air” in Italian) reflected the erroneous belief that it was an airborne disease and ranged from bloodletting to limb amputations to cutting a hole in the skull. But in the 17th Century, the first known cure for it was allegedly found here, deep in the Andes.

According to legend, quinine was discovered as a malaria cure in 1631 when the Countess of Cinchona, a Spanish noblewoman married to the viceroy of Peru, fell ill with a high fever and severe chills – the classic symptoms of malaria. Desperate to heal her, the viceroy gave his wife a concoction prepared by Jesuit priests made with the bark of an Andean tree and mixed with clove and rose-leaf syrups and other dried plants. The countess soon recovered and the miraculous plant that cured her was named “cinchona” in her honour. Today, it’s the national tree of Peru and Ecuador.

People across Europe began writing about a 'miraculous' malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World

Most historians now dispute this tale, but as with many legends, parts of it are true. Quinine, an alkaloid compound found in cinchona’s bark, can indeed kill the parasite that causes malaria. But it wasn’t discovered by Spanish Jesuits.

“Quinine was already known to the Quechua, the Cañari and the Chimú indigenous peoples that inhabited modern-day Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador before the arrival of the Spanish,” said Canales. “They were the ones that introduced the bark to Spanish Jesuits.” The Jesuits crushed the cinnamon-coloured bark into a thick, bitter powder that could be easily digested. The concoction came to be known as “Jesuits Powder”, and soon, people across Europe began writing about a “miraculous” malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World. By the 1640s, Jesuits had established trade routes to transport cinchona bark throughout Europe.

In France, quinine was used to cure intermittent fevers of France’s King Louis XIV at the court of Versailles. In Rome, the powder was tested by the Pope’s private physician and distributed for free by the Jesuit priests to the public. But in Protestant England, the drug was met with some scepticism, as some doctors labelled the Catholic-promoted concoction a “papal poison”. Oliver Cromwell allegedly died of malarial complications after refusing “Jesuit Powder”. Nevertheless, by 1677, cinchona bark was first listed by the Royal College of Physicians in its London Pharmacopoeia as an official medicine used by English physicians to treat patients.

To fuel their cinchona craze, Europeans hired locals to find the precious “fever tree” in the rainforest, scrape its bark with a machete and take it to cargo ships awaiting in Peruvian ports. Increased demand for cinchona quickly led the Spanish to declare the Andes “the pharmacy of the world”, and as Canales explained, the cinchona tree soon become scarce.

Cinchona’s value soared during the 19th Century, when malaria was one of the greatest threats faced by European troops deployed in overseas colonies. According to Dr Rohan Deb Roy, author of Malarial Subjects, obtaining adequate supplies of quinine became a strategic advantage in the race for global domination, and cinchona bark turned into one of the world’s hottest commodities.

Quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major 'tools of imperialism' that powered the British Empire

“European soldiers engaged in colonial wars frequently died of malaria,” said Deb Roy. “Drugs like quinine enabled soldiers to survive in tropical colonies and win wars.”

As he explains, cinchona was especially used by the Dutch in Indonesia; by the French in Algeria; and most famously, by the British in India, Jamaica and across South-East Asia and West Africa. In fact, between 1848 and 1861, the British government spent the equivalent of £6.4m each year importing cinchona bark to store for its colonial troops. As a result, quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major “tools of imperialism” that powered the British Empire.

“Much like countries today are rushing to get to a Covid-19 vaccine to get a competitive advantage, countries back then rushed to get quinine” explained Patricia Schlagenhauf, a professor of travel medicine at the University of Zurich specialising in malaria.

Churchill allegedly said the drink had saved 'more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire'

It wasn’t just cinchona bark that was valuable. Its seeds become a high-demand commodity too. “British and Dutch governments wanted to plant cinchona in their own colonies to stop their dependence on South America,” Deb Roy explained. But choosing the right seed wasn’t easy. Each of the 23 species of cinchona has a different quinine content. It was thanks to locals with indigenous botanical knowledge that Europeans could secure quinine-rich species to export abroad.

By the mid-1850s, the British had successfully established “fever tree” plantations in southern India, where malaria was rampant. Soon, British authorities started distributing locally harvested quinine to soldiers and civil servants. It’s long been rumoured that they allegedly mixed gin with their quinine to make it more palatable, thus inventing the first tonic water and the famous gin and tonic drink. Today, small amounts of quinine are still found in tonic water. But as Kim Walker, who co-authored the book Just the Tonic points out, this British origin story is likely a myth. “It seems like they added whatever was handy” – be it rum, brandy or arrack, she explained.

Plus, as Schlagenhauf adds, quinine has a short lifespan in the body so sipping on a gin and tonic at cocktail hour would not be enough to guarantee protection against malaria. Nevertheless, the myth of gin and tonic as a potent anti-malaria prevention tricked even Winston Churchill, who allegedly said the drink had saved “more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire.”

Of course, the gin and tonic is just one drink tied to the “fever tree”. Today, the most famous cocktail in Peru may be the American-invented pisco sour, but the most popular among Peruvians is arguably the bitter, quinine-flavoured pisco tonic, a homegrown invention that’s often mixed with maiz morado (purple corn) from the Andes to make a pisco morada tonic. If you’ve ever sipped liqueurs like Campari, Pimm’s or the French aperitif Lillet (a key ingredient in James Bond’s famous Vesper martini), you’ve tasted quinine. It’s also found in Scotland’s “other” national drink, Irn-Bru, and in what is reported to be Queen Elizabeth II’s favourite drink, gin and Dubonnet – an aperitif which, coincidentally, was invented by a French chemist to make quinine more palatable for French troops stationed in North African colonies.

Quinine was eventually pushed aside in the 1970s by artemisinin, a drug derived from the sweet wormwood plant, as the world’s go-to malaria remedy. Still, the legacy of quinine runs deep around the world. Today, Ban-dung, Indonesia, is known as “The Paris of Java” because the Dutch transformed this once-sleepy port into the world’s largest quinine centre, brimming with Art Deco buildings, ballrooms and hotels. English is widely spoken in places as diverse as India, Hong Kong, Sierra Leone, Kenya and coastal Sri Lanka; and French in Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria today partly because of quinine. And in Spanish, there is still an expression that states, “ser más malo que la quina” – which roughly translates as, “to be worse than quinine”, a reference to the bark’s bitter taste.

At the height of the global “quinine hunt” in the 1850s, Peru and Bolivia both established monopolies over their highly lucrative tree bark exports. In fact, much of La Paz’s Neoclassical cathedral and many of the cobblestone streets running through the city’s plaza-filled historic centre today were built with cinchona bark, which at one point accounted for 15% of Bolivia’s total tax revenue.

However, the centuries-long demand for cinchona bark has left a visible scar on its native habitat. In 1805, explorers documented 25,000 cinchona trees in the Ecuadorean Andes. The same area, now part of the Podocarpus National Park, counts just 29 trees.

It is to plants that we owe some of the major medicinal breakthroughs in human history

Canales explained that the removal of quinine-rich species from the Andes has changed the genetic structure of cinchona plants, reducing their ability to evolve and change. Part of Canales’ work, in collaboration with the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew outside London, is to look at old cinchona bark specimens preserved in museums to study how human behaviour may have altered the plant. “We think that cinchona may have evolved to contain less quinine because of overharvesting,” she explained.

Recently, the World Health Organization halted studies of quinine’s synthetic descendant, hydroxychloroquine, as a possible coronavirus treatment amid safety concerns. Despite the fact that the drug is now developed in labs versus extracted from forests, Canales says the protection of the cinchona and the endangered “pharmacy of the world” that nurtures it, is crucial for the discovery of new drugs in the future.

In the absence of government protection of cinchona, local conservation groups are stepping in. Environmental organisation Semilla Bendita, literally “blessed seeds”, is planning to plant 2021 cinchona seeds for the 200th anniversary of Peru’s independence in 2021, and scientists like Schlagenhauf hope that more efforts to preserve the Andes’ biodiversity will follow.

“What the story of quinine shows is that biodiversity and human health go hand in hand,” Schlagenhauf said. “People often think of plant-based remedies as ‘alternative medicine’, but it is to plants that we owe some of the major medicinal breakthroughs in human history.

231,The tree that changed the world map,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200527-the-tree-that-changed-the-world-map,['Vittoria Traverso'],"Unfurling in a carpet of green where the Andes and Amazon basin meet in south-western Peru, Manú National Park is one of the most biodiverse corners of the planet: a lush, 1.5-million hectare Unesco-inscribed nature reserve wrapped in mist, covered in a chaos of vines and largely untouched by humans.

Where to see the rare cinchona tree Manú National Park, Peru: A haven of biodiversity, the Unesco nature preserve is home to an estimated 5,000 plant species. Podocarpus National Park, Ecuador: One of the last places to spot Ecuador’s national tree. Hiking through its misty trails, you may also encounter the spectacled bear, one of the Andes’ most emblematic animals. Cutervo National Park, Peru: Peru’s oldest protected area is famous for its pre-Columbian archaeological remains, 88 species of orchids and for being the last remaining cloud forest in the Peruvian highlands. Semilla Bendita Botanical Garden, Peru: This botanical garden operated by local environmentalists is home to more than 1,300 native species – including orchids and cinchonas.

But if you hack your way through the rainforest’s dense jungle, cross its rushing rivers and avoid the jaguars and pumas, you may see one of the few remaining specimens of the endangered cinchona officinalis tree. To the untrained eye, the thin, 15m-tall tree may blend into the thicketed maze. But the flowering plant, which is native to the Andean foothills, has inspired many myths and shaped human history for centuries.

“This may not be a well-known tree,” said Nataly Canales, who grew up in the Peruvian Amazonian region of Madre de Dios. “Yet, a compound extracted from this plant has saved millions of lives in human history.”

Today, Canales is a biologist at the National Museum of Denmark who is tracing the genetic history of cinchona. As she explained, it was the bark of this rare tree that gave the world quinine, the world’s first anti-malarial drug. And while the discovery of quinine was welcomed by the world with both excitement and suspicion hundreds of years ago, in recent weeks, this tree’s medical derivatives have been at the centre of another heated global debate. Synthetic versions of quinine – such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – have been touted and largely disputed as possible treatments for the novel coronavirus.

For centuries, malaria, a disease caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, has plagued people across the world. It ravaged the Roman Empire; it killed between 150 to 300 million people in the 20th Century; and, according to the World Health Organization, nearly half of the world’s population still lives in areas where the disease is transmitted.

Medieval remedies to cure “mal aria” (“bad air” in Italian) reflected the erroneous belief that it was an airborne disease and ranged from bloodletting to limb amputations to cutting a hole in the skull. But in the 17th Century, the first known cure for it was allegedly found here, deep in the Andes.

According to legend, quinine was discovered as a malaria cure in 1631 when the Countess of Cinchona, a Spanish noblewoman married to the viceroy of Peru, fell ill with a high fever and severe chills – the classic symptoms of malaria. Desperate to heal her, the viceroy gave his wife a concoction prepared by Jesuit priests made with the bark of an Andean tree and mixed with clove and rose-leaf syrups and other dried plants. The countess soon recovered and the miraculous plant that cured her was named “cinchona” in her honour. Today, it’s the national tree of Peru and Ecuador.

People across Europe began writing about a 'miraculous' malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World

Most historians now dispute this tale, but as with many legends, parts of it are true. Quinine, an alkaloid compound found in cinchona’s bark, can indeed kill the parasite that causes malaria. But it wasn’t discovered by Spanish Jesuits.

“Quinine was already known to the Quechua, the Cañari and the Chimú indigenous peoples that inhabited modern-day Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador before the arrival of the Spanish,” said Canales. “They were the ones that introduced the bark to Spanish Jesuits.” The Jesuits crushed the cinnamon-coloured bark into a thick, bitter powder that could be easily digested. The concoction came to be known as “Jesuits Powder”, and soon, people across Europe began writing about a “miraculous” malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World. By the 1640s, Jesuits had established trade routes to transport cinchona bark throughout Europe.

In France, quinine was used to cure intermittent fevers of France’s King Louis XIV at the court of Versailles. In Rome, the powder was tested by the Pope’s private physician and distributed for free by the Jesuit priests to the public. But in Protestant England, the drug was met with some scepticism, as some doctors labelled the Catholic-promoted concoction a “papal poison”. Oliver Cromwell allegedly died of malarial complications after refusing “Jesuit Powder”. Nevertheless, by 1677, cinchona bark was first listed by the Royal College of Physicians in its London Pharmacopoeia as an official medicine used by English physicians to treat patients.

To fuel their cinchona craze, Europeans hired locals to find the precious “fever tree” in the rainforest, scrape its bark with a machete and take it to cargo ships awaiting in Peruvian ports. Increased demand for cinchona quickly led the Spanish to declare the Andes “the pharmacy of the world”, and as Canales explained, the cinchona tree soon become scarce.

Cinchona’s value soared during the 19th Century, when malaria was one of the greatest threats faced by European troops deployed in overseas colonies. According to Dr Rohan Deb Roy, author of Malarial Subjects, obtaining adequate supplies of quinine became a strategic advantage in the race for global domination, and cinchona bark turned into one of the world’s hottest commodities.

Quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major 'tools of imperialism' that powered the British Empire

“European soldiers engaged in colonial wars frequently died of malaria,” said Deb Roy. “Drugs like quinine enabled soldiers to survive in tropical colonies and win wars.”

As he explains, cinchona was especially used by the Dutch in Indonesia; by the French in Algeria; and most famously, by the British in India, Jamaica and across South-East Asia and West Africa. In fact, between 1848 and 1861, the British government spent the equivalent of £6.4m each year importing cinchona bark to store for its colonial troops. As a result, quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major “tools of imperialism” that powered the British Empire.

“Much like countries today are rushing to get to a Covid-19 vaccine to get a competitive advantage, countries back then rushed to get quinine” explained Patricia Schlagenhauf, a professor of travel medicine at the University of Zurich specialising in malaria.

Churchill allegedly said the drink had saved 'more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire'

It wasn’t just cinchona bark that was valuable. Its seeds become a high-demand commodity too. “British and Dutch governments wanted to plant cinchona in their own colonies to stop their dependence on South America,” Deb Roy explained. But choosing the right seed wasn’t easy. Each of the 23 species of cinchona has a different quinine content. It was thanks to locals with indigenous botanical knowledge that Europeans could secure quinine-rich species to export abroad.

By the mid-1850s, the British had successfully established “fever tree” plantations in southern India, where malaria was rampant. Soon, British authorities started distributing locally harvested quinine to soldiers and civil servants. It’s long been rumoured that they allegedly mixed gin with their quinine to make it more palatable, thus inventing the first tonic water and the famous gin and tonic drink. Today, small amounts of quinine are still found in tonic water. But as Kim Walker, who co-authored the book Just the Tonic points out, this British origin story is likely a myth. “It seems like they added whatever was handy” – be it rum, brandy or arrack, she explained.

Plus, as Schlagenhauf adds, quinine has a short lifespan in the body so sipping on a gin and tonic at cocktail hour would not be enough to guarantee protection against malaria. Nevertheless, the myth of gin and tonic as a potent anti-malaria prevention tricked even Winston Churchill, who allegedly said the drink had saved “more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire.”

Of course, the gin and tonic is just one drink tied to the “fever tree”. Today, the most famous cocktail in Peru may be the American-invented pisco sour, but the most popular among Peruvians is arguably the bitter, quinine-flavoured pisco tonic, a homegrown invention that’s often mixed with maiz morado (purple corn) from the Andes to make a pisco morada tonic. If you’ve ever sipped liqueurs like Campari, Pimm’s or the French aperitif Lillet (a key ingredient in James Bond’s famous Vesper martini), you’ve tasted quinine. It’s also found in Scotland’s “other” national drink, Irn-Bru, and in what is reported to be Queen Elizabeth II’s favourite drink, gin and Dubonnet – an aperitif which, coincidentally, was invented by a French chemist to make quinine more palatable for French troops stationed in North African colonies.

Quinine was eventually pushed aside in the 1970s by artemisinin, a drug derived from the sweet wormwood plant, as the world’s go-to malaria remedy. Still, the legacy of quinine runs deep around the world. Today, Ban-dung, Indonesia, is known as “The Paris of Java” because the Dutch transformed this once-sleepy port into the world’s largest quinine centre, brimming with Art Deco buildings, ballrooms and hotels. English is widely spoken in places as diverse as India, Hong Kong, Sierra Leone, Kenya and coastal Sri Lanka; and French in Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria today partly because of quinine. And in Spanish, there is still an expression that states, “ser más malo que la quina” – which roughly translates as, “to be worse than quinine”, a reference to the bark’s bitter taste.

At the height of the global “quinine hunt” in the 1850s, Peru and Bolivia both established monopolies over their highly lucrative tree bark exports. In fact, much of La Paz’s Neoclassical cathedral and many of the cobblestone streets running through the city’s plaza-filled historic centre today were built with cinchona bark, which at one point accounted for 15% of Bolivia’s total tax revenue.

However, the centuries-long demand for cinchona bark has left a visible scar on its native habitat. In 1805, explorers documented 25,000 cinchona trees in the Ecuadorean Andes. The same area, now part of the Podocarpus National Park, counts just 29 trees.

It is to plants that we owe some of the major medicinal breakthroughs in human history

Canales explained that the removal of quinine-rich species from the Andes has changed the genetic structure of cinchona plants, reducing their ability to evolve and change. Part of Canales’ work, in collaboration with the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew outside London, is to look at old cinchona bark specimens preserved in museums to study how human behaviour may have altered the plant. “We think that cinchona may have evolved to contain less quinine because of overharvesting,” she explained.

Recently, the World Health Organization halted studies of quinine’s synthetic descendant, hydroxychloroquine, as a possible coronavirus treatment amid safety concerns. Despite the fact that the drug is now developed in labs versus extracted from forests, Canales says the protection of the cinchona and the endangered “pharmacy of the world” that nurtures it, is crucial for the discovery of new drugs in the future.

In the absence of government protection of cinchona, local conservation groups are stepping in. Environmental organisation Semilla Bendita, literally “blessed seeds”, is planning to plant 2021 cinchona seeds for the 200th anniversary of Peru’s independence in 2021, and scientists like Schlagenhauf hope that more efforts to preserve the Andes’ biodiversity will follow.

“What the story of quinine shows is that biodiversity and human health go hand in hand,” Schlagenhauf said. “People often think of plant-based remedies as ‘alternative medicine’, but it is to plants that we owe some of the major medicinal breakthroughs in human history.

233,Sweden’s single-diner restaurant,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200526-swedens-single-diner-restaurant,['Lola Akinmade Åkerström'],"The romantic picture of sitting in a lush meadow surrounded by blooming wildflowers and dining from a picnic basket might conjure up thoughts of Instagram lifestyle influencers, who tend to be mostly female. But for Linda Karlsson, her novel dining idea’s main demographic has surprised her.

“Men,” she said. “It has been almost only men who have booked the table.”

“The table” she refers to is, in fact, her new restaurant Bord För En (Table For One), which opened on 10 May. Located in Ransäter, a tiny rural town tucked in the Swedish countryside in Värmland, around 350km west of Stockholm, it consists of a sole wooden table and single chair set in her garden overlooking a verdant pasture. A candle and bouquet of wildflowers finish off the demure table setting.

The food is a way of sending people to a warm and slow night in Barcelona since we’re unable to travel during these times

The story behind this new venture is as sweet as the setting. When Karlsson’s elderly parents wanted to visit her during the current Covid-19 situation, she and her partner, Rasmus Persson, needed to devise a way of sharing a meal with them without compromising their health. Since they couldn’t sit at the same table for safety reasons, they decided to set up a table outside in the garden to “remotely dine” with Karlsson’s parents while they conversed through the window.

Watching that tranquil scene as her parents dined outside lit a creative spark within both Karlsson and Persson. They realised they could invite others to enjoy this peaceful solitude while still maintaining some social distancing.

And thus, the idea of their single-diner restaurant was born.

Each evening at 19:00, their solo customer takes a seat at the table and eats alone to the sounds of rustling trees and chirping birds. There are no wait staff and no direct human contact. To deliver the food safely, a red and white gingham-frill basket is attached to a rope and served from Karlsson’s second-floor kitchen window via a pulley system fashioned using an old bicycle wheel to their guest sitting 50m away.

• America's 'fried chicken war'

• The Swedish word poached by the world

• The dish that ended the plague

This setup not only allows them to adhere to the current recommendations from the Public Health Agency of Sweden to maintain 1-2m of space between people, but allows diners complete solitude and tranquillity.

Once the guest opens the basket, they’ll find the first of their three courses. To notify the kitchen that they are ready for their next course, they simply need to ring the bell attached to the pulley system. The menu is always the same; changes are only made if Karlsson and Persson can’t get hold of the locally produced goods they’re committed to using as part of their food philosophy.

While Karlsson’s background is in hospitality and communications, their plant-based, vegetarian-friendly three-course offering is crafted by Persson, who trained as a chef in Gothenburg, worked at high-end seafood restaurant Sjömagasinet and learned from legendary Swedish chef Leif Mannerström. Persson’s gastronomic stints also took him to Barcelona, and his cuisine is infused with Spanish-inspired elements.

The first course is råraka, Swedish-style hash browns with thick smetana sour cream, seaweed caviar and sorrel. It’s followed by “Black & Yellow”, a plating of yellow carrot-ginger puree, browned hazelnut butter, sweetcorn croquette (redolent of Spanish tapas) and serpent root (Spanish salsify) ash.

“The food is a way of sending people to a warm and slow night in Barcelona since we’re unable to travel during these times,” Karlsson said.

The dessert, called “Last Days of Summer”, is ginned blueberries with iced buttermilk and viola sugar made from their homegrown beetroots. It’s a secret recipe handed down from Persson’s grandmother, who recently passed away at 99 years old.

“Rasmus knows how to make these dishes at home, so I'm very pleased,” Karlsson said. “And since I can't cook at all, that's one reason why I married a chef.”

Drink pairings are made from non-alcoholic spirit Seedlip with seasonal ingredients such as elderflower and strawberries, and are curated by renowned bar owner Joel Söderbäck, who grew up in Ransäter and whose Stockholm-based cocktail bar Tjoget was awarded a spot on the World's 50 Best Bars in 2019.

Due to current travel restrictions worldwide, most of Bord För En's patrons so far have been locals from Ransäter and the region of Värmland, and the waitlist can range from a few people to more than a dozen depending on the day of the week. While many people have tried to make a two-person reservation, suggesting that their dining partners can sit on the grass to enforce social distancing, Karlsson notes that this defeats the purpose of the solo experience.

“It’s really about having the time to get to know yourself and to truly honour that,” Karlsson said.

She believes there’s more to her concept than just novelty. What was a call of duty to help enforce social distancing guidelines has unwittingly turned into a quiet, self-care movement. With much of the world in lockdown or quarantine, Karlsson believes people are realising they’re afraid of spending time alone, and she wants to help turn the experience into a positive one.

“Our business model is not a very lucrative one,” says Karlsson. “We only accept one guest per day just to be able to really have the opportunity to make our guests create their own space.”

It’s really about having the time to get to know yourself and to truly honour that

For Karlsson, it’s hard to put a time limit on creating that personal introspective space. It often makes her think of American poet Mary Oliver’s poem “The Summer Day” and the question it poses: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” That’s why, beyond supplying the food and the venue, she leaves the exact experience up to the guest, who is free to linger for hours over their meal, read, write, soak up nature, and fully exist in the moment without distractions. There’s no closing time or harried waiter bringing the bill.

In fact, there’s no bill at all. In lieu of payment, guests are invited to make a voluntary contribution based on what they feel the meal and experience was worth to them. Karlsson and Persson were never planning to turn profits from serving a single meal a day, and are instead donating proceeds to Ulla-Britt Henrikssons Kulturstipendium, a fund to support creative mothers set up by Persson. Named after his mother Ulla-Britt and inspired by her setting aside her own creative dreams to raise him and his siblings, the fund awards 10,000 kr (£845) on Mother’s Day, 26 May, to support a nominated mother towards realising her own artistic vision.

As for why their clientele has been mostly male? Karlsson has no idea. “I don't have the answer as to why it's been mostly men,” she said. “But our table is available to everyone.” She notes that women don’t often treat themselves out to solo dinners and maybe it’s time to consider this as one more necessary act of self-care.

Karlsson and Persson plan to keep Bord För En open until 1 August and reopen annually every spring and summer. And with lots of international interest from fellow chefs and foodie colleagues, Persson and Karlsson are now considering expanding their idea globally. They are currently inviting chefs who are interested in launching similar concepts to apply.

“Our vision is to open up more tables around the world and unite our feeling of being alone together,” said Karlsson.

238,Why First Nations communities are uninviting visitors,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200525-why-first-nations-communities-are-uninviting-visitors,['Diane Selkirk'],"The idea of Covid-19 entering the remote First Nation’s community of Bella Bella terrifies Marilyn Slett, chief councillor of the Heiltsuk Tribal Council. Located on British Columbia’s (BC) central coast, the water- and air-access only community of 1,400 is a gateway to Canada’s Great Bear Rainforest, a region the size of Ireland that’s famed for its eco-tourism opportunities.

One of 198 distinct First Nations in BC, each with its own unique traditions and history, the Heiltsuk Nation has spent years revitalising and preserving its culture. The long process reached a milestone with the November 2019 opening of the community’s first Big House (where the Heiltsuk gathered for sacred communal events) to be built in 200 years, and more plans are in the future. But, as it does in many Indigenous communities, the future takes its cues from the past. And Covid-19, which is particularly dangerous to older people, therefore puts the community’s future at risk.

“Our laws and traditions are oral,” said Slett. “They’re passed down by our Knowledge Keepers,” a group of Elders who have learned the Nation’s customs, traditions and protocols. “We only have 30 fluent Hailhzaqvla-speaking Elders left,” she added. “We’ll uphold Heiltsuk laws and do everything we can to protect them.”

Slett is referring to the emergency measures her community has put in place. Like many Indigenous communities in coastal BC, and around the world, the Heiltsuk Nation has enacted a strict lockdown, opting to go well beyond the provincial guidelines by banning all non-essential travel in or out of their territory.

We only have 30 fluent Hailhzaqvla-speaking Elders left

On the roads and in the public ferry terminals leading into the normally tourist-friendly communities on BC’s coast, checkpoints have been set up, manned by Guardian Watchmen who typically act as friendly ambassadors and cultural interpreters. Out on the water, these Guardians are using AIS (Automatic Identification System) to identify, track and intercept any boat that arrives in their waters. Their role is to ensure the vessel should be there and turn it back if it’s not. Shifted to a new frontline, these traditional protectors, stewards and guardians of First Nations lands and waters have begun rediscovering the power of protecting a Nation’s greatest treasure: its people.

Canada’s Indigenous people have always been stewards of their land and culture – but what’s changed is how they now combine Western science and law with cultural knowledge and traditional laws to secure their survival. Often, the weight of this combination is directed towards things like sovereignty claims; archaeology has been used to secure land claims. But now communities, who cherish their Elders for the guidance they provide, are listening to international health guidelines and then combining that knowledge with their own values in the way that protects the community best.

It’s not difficult to understand why the Heiltsuk have opted to manage the pandemic by following the advice of their own leaders and shutting off their community to outsiders. For 14,000 years, they have lived in balance within a territory that spans about 15,540 sq km and extends through the Great Bear Rainforest. Heiltsuk historians estimate that at their cultural peak, as many as 20,000 people lived in 50 summer and winter villages set in ancient forests of huge Sitka spruce, red cedar, western hemlock and Douglas fir.

European contact, dating from the 1780s, brought devastation. “We survived smallpox, we survived measles, we survived government policy,” Slett said. But the onslaught took its toll. In the 1880s, the remnants of the severely depleted Heiltsuk communities gathered into one village near Bella Bella: their population had been diminished to around 200 people.

And then the 1918 flu came. “My mom told me about my grandmother who remembered the ladies crying and talking about all of the losses. There were whole households passing away – and no time for proper burials,” said Slett.

Cultural devastation wasn’t unique to the Heiltsuk. In many Indigenous tourism offerings in Canada, that painful and turbulent journey is something visitors learn about. “Our most effective businesses are built around sharing culture and cultural revitalisation,” said Keith Henry, president and CEO of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada.

Since time immemorial, Guardians have had a role in managing land and water and in exerting rights

More than opportunities to see wildlife, hear songs or learn how people create art or survive off the land; modern Indigenous tourism in Canada is a $1.8bn industry that combines experiences with culture in a way that celebrates the warmth, humour and resilience of Indigenous people.

“It’s not Disney-fying us, it’s not making us like a petting zoo; it’s really just sharing who we are,” said Henry.

Located 55km north of Bella Bella, the Kitasoo / Xai'xais Nations village of Klemtu is also on lockdown. Chief councillor Roxanne Robinson says the decision to close the community to outsiders was an obvious one, as “protecting the health and safety of people is the work of a leader”.

The rugged landscape and wildlife, which includes whales, coastal wolves, black bears, grizzly bears and the spirit bear, attracts visitors from all over the world and makes up a vital part of the local economy. Robinson says that closing their community in mid-March was a hard choice, but it was just in time. Just south, Heiltsuk Watchmen on the water reported they started turning back yachts. American and Canadian boaters trying to flee big cities and those who wanted to hunt or fish (which is considered essential in BC, but not by the coastal communities) had started heading for more remote, Covid-19­-free communities.

In normal times, these Guardian Watchmen would ensure people knew to stay away from sacred sites and to follow wildlife regulations.

A global concern Inadequate healthcare and higher rates of chronic health conditions means indigenous communities around the world are at greater risk from Covid-19. Argentina: Home to at least 35 officially recognised indigenous communities, some have opted to insulate themselves from outsiders.

Australia: Some remote indigenous communities locked themselves down early. They were quickly supported by the federal government, which is using its Biosecurity Act to limit access to essential staff and services.

Brazil: With 850,000 indigenous people, different groups are responding with strict isolation; guarding their communities from outsiders and using traditional treatments.

Kenya: Maasai people have traditionally survived pandemics by isolating deeper into their territory. During Covid-19, many people are currently scattered and isolated.

US: The Navajo Nation is one of the epicentres of the virus in the US and currently has the highest infection rates in the country.

“They are an extension of nationhood,” said Claire Hutton, Indigenous Stewardship Director at conservation organisation Nature United. “Since time immemorial, Guardians have had a role in managing land and water and in exerting rights.”

In earlier Kitasoo / Xai'xais villages, Robinson said, there was always one Guardian Watchman situated outside the village to watch for strangers. While in the Heiltsuk culture, the Guardian Watchmen were informal custodians of the land and water, following traditional laws to protect food sources and conserve the landscape.

While the ancient tradition faded with colonisation, modern Guardian Watchmen programmes came into being in the 1980s with programmes in Haida Gwaii, 200km west of Bella Bella, and in the Innu territories in Labrador. Today more than 50 different programmes in Nations across Canada fulfil a wide variety of different roles, depending on what a community may need.

Hutton, who coordinates a team that provides technical support to Guardians across Canada, says the programmes are as distinct as the Nations themselves, but there are common themes and issues. Many are focused on stewardship and ensuring the protection of traditional food sources. Some have a strong science focus, and Guardians are critical for data collection and monitoring biodiversity or species at risk. Other programmes concentrate on tourism and the Guardians act as interpreters.

The goal of Nature United is to support the Guardians with resources that match their requirements. But manning checkpoints to prevent the spread of Covid-19 has brought up an unexpected set of needs. “Offering conflict training and Tactical Communications webinars is new,” Hutton said.

As the Guardian Watchmen shift from scientific data gathering and land preservation to guarding the frontlines, they’ve encountered pushback from travellers who question their authority. While British Columbia’s Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation agree that First Nations have the authority to restrict travel into their communities, at the same time the province, like many places, has begun reopening, forcing Indigenous communities to protect themselves.

Slett says while it would be better if Canada and BC reinforced Indigenous restrictions, the communities have the knowledge they need and are ready to safeguard themselves.

Following traditional laws, which focus on balancing the needs of the people, the environment and the economy, coastal Nations, which battled each other in ancient times, have come together. In an effort to keep out outsiders, Haida Gwaii and the Central and North Coast, including the Heiltsuk and Kitasoo / Xai'xais Nations, have set up a coalition. They are working collectively to let visitors know that while they are valued and wanted, now is not the time to visit. The communities are simply too vulnerable to risk any loss.

We are self-isolating at this time so that when we gather again, nobody is left behind

“We know that this isn’t over and it’s going to be a few years before there’s a vaccination and it’s no longer a threat to humankind,” Slett said. “Indigenous communities cannot be left on the sidelines and on the fringes of what’s going on. We need to work together as we uphold our measures.”

Meanwhile the Heiltsuk – and other locked-down communities that have closed their borders ­– have turned inward. “We have Guardian Watchmen that are out there daily. We also have a patrol that monitors the entry points of the community,” said Slett. “And we’re turning to our Knowledge Keepers to see what we can do in terms of adapting during this period.”

What the Knowledge Keepers are teaching is the value of self-sufficiency. All along the coast, communities are relying more heavily on traditional marine foods like eulachon oil, smoked salmon, fresh herring eggs and roasted seaweed. Community gardens are being started and leaders are encouraging people to find strength in the power of looking after themselves.

“If you look through our histories, I can’t imagine our ancestors or our leadership of 30, 40, 50, 100 years ago having the kind of confidence to determine our future this directly,” said Henry. While the financial implications of shutting down tourism will hurt communities, he added, the whole point of tourism all along has been to strengthen the culture: Nations making their own decisions does that.

Slett said that they want tourists, they want visitors, but later. Right now, they need to get everyone through the pandemic safely: “One of our staff members posted this on Facebook: “We are self-isolating at this time so that when we gather again, nobody is left behind.”

241,How to make pizza like a Neapolitan master,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200415-how-to-make-pizza-like-a-neapolitan-master,['Ondine Cohane'],"When you think of Italy’s most memorable dishes, its beloved pizza will most likely be among your top five, if not top three, favourites. It’s an ultimate comfort food that has become an ever-growing obsession around the world. But what is it that makes pizza from Italy so special, and where do you find the very best?

The most important thing was to see the humanity and connection there needs to be in a pizzeria

Like so many of the country’s most prized gastronomic delights like wine, olive oil and cheese, the quintessential pie from Naples, where pizza was born, has become so cherished that it’s now worthy of its own Designation of Controlled Origin (DOC). The city’s pizza-making tradition even received Unesco recognition in 2017 as an intangible cultural heritage item.

Naples is, of course, the hub of the pizza napoletana (Neapolitan pizza), with generations of the same family groomed in the art of being a pizzaiolo (pizzamaker). And each family carefully guards its recipe variations and bakes pizza with a passion that’s matched perhaps only by the city’s love for its football team.

There are three basic types of Neapolitan pizza: the Margherita, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil; the marinara, which skips the cheese and uses oregano and garlic instead of basil; and the “DOC” made with mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella) instead of the usual fior di latte made from cow’s milk.

Pizza is said to have originated in the city in the 1700s, after explorers brought one of the essential ingredients, the tomato, from Peru. But even before that, Neapolitans had been eating a version of the pita brought from Arabic immigrants as a kind of flatbread – which eventually became “pizza” in the local dialect. Most upper-class Europeans viewed the new tomato import with suspicion and originally considered it to be poisonous; at no fault of the tomato, people would place the acidic fruits on pewter plates, from which they’d leach lead, causing illness. But in a time of almost famine, local Neapolitans started topping their humble but delicious flatbreads with tomatoes, and soon the creation became a staple of the city’s cuisine.

Following the 1861 unification of the country, baker Raffaele Esposito was credited, in 1889, with inventing the now ubiquitous Margherita pizza in honour of the visit of Queen Margherita di Savoia, the wife of King Umberto the I, to the city. The colours of the Italian flag were mirrored in the ingredients: tomatoes for red; cheese for white; and basil for green. And thus, the iconic pizza was born.

Today, there are more than 500 pizzerias in Naples, but only a fifth of them are certified by the True Neapolitan Pizza Association, an organisation that was created in 1984 to protect and distinguish the authentic pies from the wannabees. Its criteria is based not only on the ingredients that go into the pie – including everything from the type of flour in the dough to the provenance of the cheese – but also the preparation, from the dough fermentation style to oven temperature. The association now even holds an annual contest to judge which pizza makers are the best in the world. Franco Pepe from Pepe in Grani has won the last three years in a row.

Pizza makers like Pepe have achieved a kind of rock-star status in Italy nowadays, but the work is quite physically exhausting, with a great attention given to seemingly simple methods.

Among the most famous pizzaioli in town, Gino Sorbillo is a third-generation dough wizard who runs Gino e Toto Sorbillo pizzeria, which is often considered one of Naples’ best. His father was one of 21 children (number 19), all of whom helped with the family’s pizza-making business. It was the same for Sorbillo’s generation: “[The whole family] assisted in every step from buying the materials, [making] the dough and seeing how to treat the ingredients,” he explained. “But the most important thing was to see the humanity and connection there needs to be in a pizzeria,” as the pizza-making process requires manual labour, long hours, and, for the Sorbillo family, working in a humble and sometimes difficult part of town.

His grandfather opened the family’s first pizza parlour back in 1935 along Via dei Tribunali, a historically troubled street in the centre of Naples that’s been rife with organised crime. That background has always been on Sorbillo’s mind, who wants to promote the city he loves and provide a refuge from gang activity for his patrons and workers. His Naples location was bombed last year, but ever determined, he has since reopened.

Sorbillo now has pizzerias in places like Tokyo and New York, and although he monitors each one for its adherence to the family’s recipes, it’s this first location in Via dei Tribunali that remains the business’ centrepiece, where locals and tourists alike line up to taste the original pizza. The pizzeria has also helped breathe life into the city, which has a reputation for being the country’s most chaotic and among its poorest. “I think I also gave some younger people the inspiration that we could do something here in Naples, to say, ‘we are going to try to so something too’,” he said.

It’s [how you make] the dough that’s essential

So, how does one make an authentic Neapolitan pizza, especially for those who can’t go to Naples to eat one?

To begin with, the dough has to be just right, with the use of Italian 00 or 0 wheat flour, fresh brewer’s yeast (no dry yeast), water and salt. The dough must be rolled by hand or with a slow speed mixer; never using a rolling pin. However, twirling it in the air to oxygenate the dough while belting out a Neapolitan classic might be best left to the professional pizzaioli.

Ciro Salvo of 50 Kalò, another of the city’s most esteemed masters, has another dough-making must: “The fermentation and leavening of the dough must be at least 10 to 12 hours.”

Raw, pureed tomatoes are another necessary ingredient for a great pie – preferably San Marzano, Italy’s most prized variety, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius and are required for pizzas with DOC designation. However, pizza star Franco Pepe prefers to use his own home-grown heirloom tomatoes.

Only two types of mozzarella are used for Neapolitan pizza: fior di latte made from cow’s milk; or mozzarella di bufala, made from the milk of the water buffalo that live in the country’s Campania and Lazio regions. These days, at some farms, the gentle beasts receive massages and listen to classic music as part of their routine to produce the tastiest milk around.

Of course, part of Neapolitan pizza’s fame comes from how it’s cooked. The dough must be no more than 3mm thick, and must bake for 60 to 90 seconds at a very high temperature – 485°C – inside a wood-burning oven, resulting in a pizza that’s crispy but not burnt. It all sounds easy enough, but there is a reason why some pizzamakers are considered true masters: that moment just before a pie becomes a burned mistake often lies in an expert’s eye.

But even if you don’t have DOC-qualified ingredients or a wood-burning oven, according to Sorbillo, all you really need to make a good pie is flour, yeast, a can of tomatoes and cheese that’s made from cow’s milk. “It’s [how you make] the dough that’s essential,” he said.

And as with any pastime, pizza-making involves a bit of trial and error. Mistakes and all, the whole process – along with getting to enjoy the final result – is all part of the fun.

A home challenge The True Neapolitan Pizza Association is holding a free contest called #VeraPizzaContest for pizza makers (amateur and professionals alike) to see who makes the best pizza designed and made at home. Entries close on 20 April.

“I am lucky,” Salvo said. “It’s not just my work but my passion and my life.” He himself eats a Margherita pizza at least once a day.

Neapolitan pizza dough recipe

By Ciro Salvo of 50 Kalò

450g flour (ideally 00, but can use 0 or 1)

300ml cold tap water

3g fresh brewer's yeast

9g salt

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the cold tap water, and then mix in about two-thirds of the flour with a big spoon until a creamy consistency is formed. Mix in the salt, and then the remaining flour a little bit at a time. Continue to mix until all the flour has been absorbed.

Knead energetically with your hands by folding the dough and pushing it inwards. When the dough is smooth and no longer has lumps, let it rest for 10-15 minutes.

Dust the dough with flour, place it on a table and then give it a few folds, forming it into a spherical shape until it’s firm and elastic.

Place dough inside an oiled baking tin and cover, and then allow it to rest and rise for 7-8 hours at room temperature.

Place dough onto a round sheet pan that’s been lightly greased with olive oil, and lightly press it with your fingertips until the classical, flat-and-round pizza shape is formed (or into a square if using a square-shaped pan). It should be no more than 3mm thick. Cover and let rest for another 3 hours.

Add tomatoes (or tomato puree) as desired onto the flattened dough, and put pizza on the base of the oven, baking at 250-280°C for 5-6 minutes. Move pizza to the top rack of the oven and bake for another 6-8 minutes, adding drained mozzarella (if using) only in the last 3-4 minutes. Other ingredients such as extra virgin olive oil and basil should be added at the end of cooking.

50g Corbara tomatoes, drained

70g escarole, blanched

30g Caiazzo black olives, pitted

pinch of Salina capers

garlic clove, thinly sliced

pinch of oregano

extra virgin olive oil

Place already-prepared dough onto a baking sheet and lightly press flat. It should be no more than 3mm thick.

Top with tomatoes and bake at 250-280°C for 5-6 minutes. Add escarole, black olives, capers, garlic and bake in the oven at 250-300°C for another 6-8 minutes. Add oregano and a trickle of olive oil.

Scientists have found that the submerged forest contains pine, alder, oak and birch tree stumps, which have all been preserved due to the lack of oxygen and high alkaline levels found in the bog. The living trees became gradually waterlogged with peat growth when the area was inundated by rising sea levels some 4,000-5,000 years ago.

Old animal bones and a pair of deer antlers have been discovered here, too, suggesting that this stretch of land once flourished when the sea level was lower and before the area had completely succumbed to the ocean. Whether or not the forest is actually the one mentioned in the myth of Cantre’r Gwaelod, archaeologists believe there was life here dating back to at least the Bronze Age (3000 to 1200BC), in part because of the discovery of a timber walkway made of coppiced branches and upright posts (designed to cope with rising water levels) that’s thought to be between 3,100 and 4,000 years old.

Various other archaeological discoveries have been made here, including fossilised human and animal footprints preserved in the hardened top layer of peat, along with scatterings of burnt stones thought to be from ancient hearths. Due to this evidence of human settlement, the area is often referred to as “the Atlantis of Wales” in the media.","Evidence of lifeScientists have found that the submerged forest contains pine, alder, oak and birch tree stumps, which have all been preserved due to the lack of oxygen and high alkaline levels found in the bog.

244,The travel 'ache' you can’t translate,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200323-the-travel-ache-you-cant-translate,['David Farley'],"Every time I feel like I’ve reached the most remote place I’ve ever travelled, I hear “Guten tag”, and see a German rounding the corner, nonchalantly strolling by like he or she went for a walk around in their Munich or Hamburg neighbourhood, got pleasantly lost, and somehow ended up here in the wilds of western Ethiopia or below the peaks the Bolivian Andes. The more I traverse the globe, the more I realise that the Germans are the great travellers of the modern world.

Our coverage during coronavirus While travelling is on hold due to the coronavirus outbreak, BBC Travel will continue to inform and inspire our readers who want to learn about the world as much as they want to travel there, offering stories that celebrate the people, places and cultures that make this world so wonderfully diverse and amazing. For travel information and stories specifically related to coronavirus, please read the latest updates from our colleagues at BBC News.

And they have several words that reflect their love of exploration. They gave us the word “wanderlust”, after all, which combines the German words wandern, meaning to “wander”, and lust, or “desire”. It’s a word so provocative to English speakers with a yen to see the world that we’ve borrowed it from the German and have taken it as our own.

But what if our lust for travel causes us a deep yearning pain, an ache that reminds us we have to get out and see the world? What if we’re trapped inside our homes because a virus has taken the Earth and its inhabitants hostage and we feel despair that we simply cannot travel at all?

Well, the Germans naturally have a word for that too.

Meet fernweh. Marrying the words fern, or distance, and wehe, an ache or sickness, the word can be roughly translated as “distance sickening” or “far woe” – a pain to see far-flung places beyond our doorstep. Think of it as the opposite of heimweh (homesickness). It’s an ache many of us have felt but hitherto we didn’t have a word to describe it. We do now.

Often online English language dictionaries will define fernweh simply as “wanderlust” and then explain that it means a “desire to travel”. But these bland definitions are way off the mark. Plus, there’s a big difference. Fernweh actually grew out of wanderlust, a popular word in the 19th-Century German romantic movement which valued a love of nature that stemmed from a sudden Teutonic interest in exploring Central Europe’s forests and untrammelled landscapes.

Most sources trace the word back to one Prince Hermann Ludwig Heinrich von Pückler-Muskau. A landscape gardener, Herr Pückler-Muskau also had been bitten by the travel bug and would end up publishing several books about his wanderings around Europe and North Africa (using the penname “Semilasso”). In 1835, Pückler-Muskau published The Penultimate Course of the World of Semilasso: Dream and Waking. In it, he uses the word fernweh several times, stating that he never suffers from homesickness, or heimweh, but instead suffers from the opposite affliction of fernweh.

Fernweh first appeared in English in Daniel Garrison Brinton’s 1902 book The Basis of Social Relation, in which the author described Fernweh as a deep desire or ache to travel or a “goading restlessness”. Still, though the word wanderlust was a more popular part of the German lexicon at this point. But deep into the 20th Century, German usage of wanderlust faded, replaced instead by fernweh, a word that sounds decidedly unsexy compared to the word that begat it. In the latter half of 20th Century, German travel agencies revived the word by using it in their advertisements to entice the German public to put their passports to use.

No longer were wanderlust-fuelled jaunts into the forest enough for Germans. Fernweh not only implies going beyond the borders of Germany, but journeying deep into other parts of the planet. Its more than just a lust to be on the road; it’s an actual aching or pain. Perhaps the rise of fernweh and the decline of wanderlust speaks to the emergence of the mass travel industry and the technological advancements that allowed us the ease of international travel.

Without knowing it, many of us have probably experienced fernweh. I have. One of my early memories – maybe I was three or four – was standing on a hill in my neighbourhood in Dubuque, Iowa, surveying rolling streets and houses in the distance and yearning to see what was beyond. I yearned so hard – if that’s possible – that I could feel pangs of hunger and agony in my stomach. I knew that I couldn’t go off on my own, but I made a pact with myself that when I was older, when I was big enough to bring my stuffed animal collection with me, I’d go see what was beyond the horizon. I never did get to explore, as my family moved to Los Angeles and I grew out of keeping stuffed animals. But as I got older, especially when I got a drivers’ licence, I began going down long roads just to finally see what was beyond the bend. And then I began flying and taking the bus and the train, never content to really feel settled.

“I think fernweh for Germans refers to a longing for warmer and sunnier places, palm trees, lemon trees but also a different way of life, more carefree and less ordered,” said Ilona Vandergriff, German professor at San Francisco State University (and, full disclosure, my former German professor). To really comprehend the significance of fernweh, it’s important to understand that the concept is a break from the legendarily ordered society in which Germans live. The pain or wehe was caused by a yen to escape the rigidity of the society in which they’d been raised. Vandergriff points to a passage from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s 1795 novel Wilhelm Meister’s Apprentice. In it, the character Mignon yearns to go to the “Land wo die Zitronen blühen”, or the land where the lemons bloom.

Vandergriff adds: “Goethe’s own life nicely mirrors the German travel desires: leaving the constraints of life in Germany (or in Goethe’s case, Weimar) behind and enjoying a freer life in Italy, sun, warmth, great beauty and free love.”

In an academic paper titled Home and Away: A Self-Reflexive Auto-/Ethnography scholar Christiane Alsop explains the difference between wanderlust and fernweh: “The English wanderlust expresses the longing to leave but it emphasises the tourist’s longing for a week or two of adventure. The German meaning, however, entails a horizon narrowing down on us to a point where home becomes almost suffocating and we wander off. We leave the desert of the familiar. Consequently, we meet the new environment with enthusiasm, experience the widening of our horizon as empowering and explore aspects of our identity that were buried at home.”

Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nobokov summed up the idea of fernweh quite nicely in his novel Mary, when he wrote: “Nostalgia in reverse, the longing for yet another strange land, grew especially strong in spring.”

As spring has nearly sprung in the northern hemisphere and the majority of travel-obsessed humans are planted in their homes, many of us will start feeling the aches and pains of fernweh. Which means soon enough, once we kill the coronavirus beast, there are going to be a lot of people dusting of their passport.

245,Letters from the trenches: A wartime solution to isolation,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200414-how-letter-writing-can-bring-us-together-in-tough-times,['Melissa Banigan'],"Like many young lovers separated during World War Two, my American grandparents narrated their entire romance over letters, from the beginning of their courtship in early 1944 to the Western Union telegram a year and a half later that simply read, “DARLING BE HOME BEFORE BREAKFAST LOVE GENE”.

Although the letters my grandmother wrote to her future husband were lost to time, she kept my grandfather’s letters in her possession until her death in 2005. My cousin Brooke inherited the letters and kept them tucked away in a box for nearly 10 years. In 2014, Brooke also died. Soon thereafter, her mother sent the letters to me in Brooklyn. Over a span of half a century, the letters travelled across two countries and an ocean to reach me, and they have outlived many of the people I loved best in this world. It is not hyperbole to say that they are my most precious heirloom.

I wept the first time I read the letters. During the preceding decade, I had lost a number of family members and friends to illness and accident, and I myself had flirted with death after being bedridden in an intensive care unit with pneumonia and sepsis. It was during my subsequent period of convalescence that I pored over the letters. Despite having been forced to communicate under the dark cloud of war, my grandfather filled reams of stationery with humorous wartime anecdotes and messages of hope and love. His words were just the balm I needed to soothe my ailing spirit, and seeing his beautiful handwriting brought him back to life.

Five years have passed since I first read my grandfather’s letters, and I am once again housebound. This time, just like billions of other people around the world, I am under stay-at-home orders in an effort to contain the Covid-19 virus.

Social media is a ‘double-edged sword’

During the first week of my isolation, I read the news and scrolled through my social media feeds to see how my friends and family were faring. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo warned that the virus was moving through our state “faster than a bullet train”, and some of my friends started posting about loved ones who had died or who were on ventilators. My nerves were soon worn raw by the constant onslaught of harsh realities, terrifying statistics and misinformation. I turned once again to my grandfather’s letters not only for spiritual comfort, but also in an effort to decrease my rising levels of anxiety.

“Social media is a ‘double-edged sword’,” psychotherapist Roberta Borden Wilson told me. While it allows us to stay connected to the outside world, she explained, it also forces instantaneous communication, making it impossible for us to filter out negative posts. All this negativity can trigger our brains into releasing a cascade of stress hormones that raises blood pressure, increases anxiety and depression and also contributes to substance abuse issues and addiction.

“At a time when we want to stay as healthy and strong as possible, all of this added stress can impact our immune systems, making us more susceptible to a virus,” Borden Wilson warned.

Although I was fairly certain that social media was raising my blood pressure, reading my grandfather’s letters seemed to defuse a little of my anxiety. The world melted away as I read these few lines, written mid-1945 in Joigny, France, when he was just 22 years old.

“My Dearest Darling Mary. As I lay here on my bunk, I gaze every once in a while out my window, which overlooks a broad field with a canal and river running through it. At present it looks so peaceful that one would never realize that one year ago a war was fought on this land. The grass is green and the trees in the surrounding forest are tall and strong. The evening sunset casts a glow over the pale blue sky. The little path by the canal was made for lovers, for people like you and I.”

I asked Borden Wilson if there was really something to the feelings of peacefulness and calm I experienced while reading my grandfather’s words – was the act of reading and writing letters all that different from writing social media posts?

“Absolutely,” she replied. “Writing letters engages practices that we consider within psychotherapy to be mindfulness. When we put pen to paper, we have a tendency to be more reflective and insightful and sensitive about what we write. The process makes us want to be the very best versions of ourselves. Writing letters uplifts others and we avoid the sort of negative ‘word vomit’ we see in social media.”

My grandfather was a sergeant with the US Army, a parachutist who leaped into the sky from airplanes over France’s battlefields. His friends had been deployed far and wide, scattered like seeds across the Pacific Asian and European theatres, and my grandfather didn’t know if he would ever make it home to his sweetheart. Yet his wartime letters overflowed with youthful idealism and love-sick hopes for the future:

“I love you so much that I’m really tied up. I want to make plans with you. Some day if all my dreams come true I’ll want to ask you to be my wife.”

Writing wartime letters wasn’t particular to World War Two. A couple of years ago, I visited the Verdun Memorial, a museum in north-eastern France that commemorates the horrifically bloody Battle of Verdun that took place towards the end of World War One. Situated in the bucolic countryside on what was once a battlefield, the museum is replete with displays filled with rifles, uniforms and field artillery. Yet the objects that struck me most were the personal effects soldiers had carried close to their hearts and the letters they had written to their loved ones from the trenches.

When we put pen to paper, we have a tendency to be more reflective and insightful

I spoke with Nicolas Czubak, learning resource manager at the Verdun Museum, about these remarkable letters. Regardless of their origin or social class, “all soldiers and their families were confronted with the same terrible reality of war. Yet optimism, hope for life and even humour are found in these writings,” Czubak said. Penning letters was a way for soldiers to “show that they could do something with their hands other than killing men. It helped the men,” said Czubak, “get away from the horror of war.”

Czubak believes that wartime letters can teach us patience and give us the confidence and hope necessary to endure the worst of circumstances. “We are currently facing a serious threat,” he said, “but we must keep our cool and the [potential] impacts must be put into perspective given the ordeal societies went through during the First and Second World Wars.”

Similar to Borden Wilson, Czubak believes that the act of writing a letter enables a person to thoughtfully convey their thoughts to others. “By writing letters, you take the time to step back and think. You don’t react to the moment, which helps to prevent the spread of panic and fake news.”

Re-reading my grandfather’s letters clarified all the things I was missing from my interactions on social media. My grandfather was remembered by many people as a difficult man, but his letters showed his generosity and humility. He strove to be better, without needing to be the best. And he practiced the advice many great writers give to their mentees: show, don’t tell.

My grandfather showed his future wife the world through his eyes. He gave her sunsets, and his words painted canals, wide open fields, trees reaching into the clear, blue sky. His descriptions enabled my grandmother to hold his world – idealised and ready to burst forth like a flower from a bud – in the palms of her hands.

American infantryman and historian Paul Fussell said the following about letters written during World War Two, and his thoughts are just as salient today: “Letters were a great comfort. And the mail was indispensable. We couldn’t have won the war without it. It was terribly important as a motivator of the troops. Mail call whenever it happened it was a delight.”

By writing letters, you take the time to step back and think

My grandfather’s wartime letters have inspired me to write letters of my own. Like his letters, mine offer nothing educational, nothing too smart. They are simply a way to help me stay connected to my family and friends during a dark moment in our collective human history, and they serve to quiet the cacophony produced via digital communications. Social media seems akin to the fear of God: it is everywhere; it is pervasive; and it stifles any love we might feel. Letters, however, encapsulate a moment, immortalising forever the slices of life that make us the most human. It is in these small moments that I feel closest to my fellow humans and feel the spark of the divine.

What are the things I hope future generations will learn about these difficult times? Some doctors and politicians compare treating the virus to fighting an invisible enemy, and I’ve wondered how my grandparents might have responded to the recent statement made by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who said that the health crisis is the greatest challenge for the world since World War Two. Having spent so much time reading my grandfather’s wartime letters, I suspect they might have written about the budding love they felt for each other, and then used that love to bolster themselves during their daily lives, no matter what lay ahead.

I don’t have all the answers, but I hope future generations will remember the myriad ways people held each other up, rather than how they smartly held each other accountable on social media. With this thought in mind, my handwritten letters serve only to momentarily disrupt the gravitas of the illness and death filling our world with silly stories, descriptions of what I’m making for dinner and narratives of the remarkable world I see through my window. I look forward to the day when I can mark the end of the coronavirus crisis by sending a letter similar to my grandfather’s telegram: ""DARLING BE HOME BEFORE BREAKFAST”.

For now, letters like the one I sent this morning to my mother and stepfather will have to suffice:

“Dear Mama and Alan, I’ve taken to staring out of my window at the Verrazzano Bridge, which spans the Narrows, a wide tidal straight separating my neighborhood in Brooklyn with Staten Island. I imagine that this letter is also a bridge, allowing my words to span the space between my small apartment to your living room in Rhode Island.”

246,The mysterious inverted tower steeped in Templar myth,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200220-the-mysterious-inverted-tower-steeped-in-templar-myth,"['Fernando Teixeira', 'Izabela Cardosa']","Near the manicured gardens and hilltop villas of Sintra, Portugal, lies the fairytale estate of Quinta da Regaleira. Protected within a Unesco World Heritage landscape, Quinta da Regaleira is a postcard-perfect mix of Gothic, Egyptian, Moorish and Renaissance architecture. But it’s what lies beneath the palace’s gardens that truly sets the estate’s design apart. A pair of wells, called the Initiation Wells, spiral down deep within the earth, like inverted towers. The wells were never used to collect water. Instead, they were part of a mysterious initiation ritual within the Knights of Templar tradition.

This media cannot be played on your device.

Quinta da Regaleira has had many owners over the decades, but it was António Augusto Carvalho Monteiro, one of the wealthiest men in Portugal at the turn of the 20th Century, who made the estate what it is today.

Carvalho Monteiro had a deep interest in – and was quite possibly an initiate of – the Knights Templar, a Catholic military order with roots dating to the early 12th Century. While the group is believed to have disbanded 700 years ago, certain groups, like the Freemasons, revived the medieval group’s rituals and traditions centuries later. With architect and set designer Luigi Manini, Carvalho Monteiro created a property brimming with pagan and Christian symbolism between 1904 and 1910. The property’s wells, located in the expansive gardens that Manini also designed, served as the starting point in Templar candidate initiation ceremonies.

It is believed that Templar initiations at Quinta da Regaleira began with candidates entering one of the Initiation Wells blindfolded. Holding a sword close to their heart, they would descend nine flights of stairs – a number that represents the nine founders of the Templar order. Once reaching the bottom of the well, the candidate would walk into a dark labyrinth where they would symbolically and literally find their way up towards the light. If they were able to make back through the well tower and into the sunlight, initiates would walk across stones in water to reach the chapel, where they would then be welcomed into the brotherhood.

While Templar initiations no longer take place at Quinta da Regaleira, visitors are welcomed trace the footsteps of candidates past, experiencing this ode to Portugal’s hidden myths and history firsthand.

247,How the humble potato changed the world,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200302-the-true-origins-of-the-humble-potato,['Diego Arguedas Ortiz'],"In his 1957 essay collection Mythologies, the French philosopher and literary critic Roland Barthes called chips (la frite), a food that comes from a crop native to the Americas, “patriotic” and “the alimentary sign of Frenchness”.

Despite its origins in the Andes, it’s an incredibly successful global food

Just a century earlier, a potato disease prompted a famine that halved Ireland’s population in a few years, producing a decades-long cascading effect of social and economic turmoil. And as you read these lines, the world’s leading potato producers today are China, India, Russia and Ukraine, respectively.

Despite these nations’ intimate and complicated relationships with potatoes, and how intertwined their societies and economies are with them, none can truly call them native. The humble potato was domesticated in the South American Andes some 8,000 years ago and was only brought to Europe in the mid-1500s, from where it spread west and northwards, back to the Americas, and beyond.

“Despite its origins in the Andes, it’s an incredibly successful global food,” said food historian Rebecca Earle, who’s tracing the potato’s planetary journey in a forthcoming book called Feeding the People: The Politics of the Potato. “It’s grown practically everywhere in the world, and practically everywhere, people consider it one of ‘our foods’.”

For the rest of the world beyond the Andes, the potato might not be autochthonous, but it feels local. Earle calls it the “world's most successful immigrant”, as its origin has become unrecognisable for producers and consumers everywhere. Idaho farmers in the US and gnocchi-loving Italians will claim the potato as much as any Peruvian, because its story is not only that of a country or of a region, but an account of how humans have reconfigured their relationship with land and food within a few generations.

The potato is the world’s fourth-most important crop after rice, wheat and maize, and the first among non-grains. How could an Andean tuber persuade the world, in just a few centuries, to adopt it so completely? What made the potato so irresistible was its unrivalled nutritional value, its relative easiness to cultivate as compared to some major cereals, its ability to easily navigate wars and tax censuses due to its knack for hiding underground from collectors, and in particular, its camaraderie with working men and women in the fields.

A good place to understand its origins is the Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP), or International Potato Center, a research-for-development centre that researches and promotes all things potato-related.

It’s set in an arid suburb in the Peruvian capital, Lima, and harbours a collection of thousands of potato samples from across the continent. “The Andes is where the biggest genetic diversity lies, but you can find potatoes from Chile to the United States,” René Gómez, senior curator at the CIP genebank, told me there.

He explained that potatoes were domesticated high in the Andes, near Lake Titicaca, nearly 1,000km south-east of Lima. Following domestication, these early potatoes spread through the cordillera and became a crucial food supply for indigenous communities, including the Inca, particularly as a staple foodstuff called chuño, a freeze-dried potato product that can last years or even decades.

Out of the Americas

In 1532, the Spanish invasion brought an end to the Inca but not to the cultivation of potatoes. The invaders took tubers (the underground parts of the plant we call potatoes) across the Atlantic, as they did with other crops such as tomatoes, avocados and corn, in what historians call the Great Columbian Exchange. For the first time in history, the potato ventured beyond the Americas.

These early Andean varieties had a tough time adjusting to Spain and other parts of mainland Europe. Day length is very constant across the year in the equatorial region where potatoes first were domesticated, so the potato plant was used to regular days with 12 hours of sunlight, said evolutionary geneticist Hernan A Burbano Roa.

European long summer days confused the potato plant, and tubers didn’t grow during the favourable warmer months; instead, they did so in the autumn, too close to the frosty early winter days to survive. The first decades of planting in the Old Continent proved unsuccessful.

But then potatoes found better conditions in Ireland, where a cool but frost-free fall gave the crop enough time to mature after its introduction from Spain in the 1580s. A century of farmer selection produced a variety that set tubers earlier in the summer, and the potato took the mantle it would carry for centuries: the staple crop of peasants.

The humble tuber

Villagers prized potatoes because they provided an unmatched nutritional yield per hectare. In Ireland in particular, tenants rented the land they tilled, so as lords increased their fees, they were forced to produce as much food as possible in the smallest possible area. “No crop produced more food per acre, demanded less cultivation and stored as easily as the potato,” wrote sociologist James Lang in his book Notes of a Potato Watcher.

Potatoes contain nearly every important vitamin and nutrient, except vitamins A and D, making their life-supporting properties unrivalled by any other single crop. Keep their skin and add some dairy, which provides the two missing vitamins, and you have a healthy human diet staple. You even have 2g of protein for every 100g of potato; eat 5.5 kilos per adult per day, if one’s to believe some estimates of consumption in mid-1600s Ireland, and you have a good supply.

For landless tenants in 17th- and 18th-Century Ireland, a single acre of land cultivated with potatoes and one milk cow was nutritionally sufficient for feeding a large family of six to eight. No cereal could claim that feat. Thus, began the centuries-long captivation among Irish and British peasants with the potato, grounded in rented earth and scarcity.

From the British Isles, potatoes spread eastwards across peasant fields in Northern Europe, writes Lang: they were found in the Low Countries by 1650, in Germany, Prussia and Poland by 1740 and in Russia by 1840s. After farmer-selection filtered out those varieties and genes less adapted to local climate conditions, it flourished.

Villagers in the war-ravaged European plains, by conflicts such as the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War, quickly discovered another advantage of planting potatoes: they were really hard to tax and plunder. “If you have a field of wheat, it’s really visible. You can’t hide it”, said Earle, who claims tax collectors can visually measure their size and return in time for the harvest. But underground potatoes are well hidden, and you can dig them up one by one, as needed. “Such piecemeal harvesting hid the crop from tax collectors and protected the peasant’s food supply in the war time,” said Lang in his book. “Marauding soldiers laid waste to field crops and raided grain stores. They rarely stopped to dig up an acre of spuds.”

The elites and military strategists of the time noticed this. Prussia’s King Frederick the Great ordered his government to distribute instructions on how to plant potatoes, hoping peasants would have food if enemy armies invaded during the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740. Other nations followed suit and by the time of the Napoleonic wars in the early 1800s, the potato had become Europe’s food reserve, according to a report by the Food and Agriculture Association of the United Nations (FAO).

In fact, tubers were such a valued crop during wartime that “every military campaign on European soil after about 1560 resulted in an increase in potato acreage, down to and including World War Two,” wrote historian William McNeill in his 1999 essay How the Potato Changed the World's History.

Nutrition and power

In a matter of centuries, potatoes entered the European and global economies as a staple crop. For decades, food historians (such as those noted in this FAO booklet from 2008) have explained this spread as the result of well-meaning Enlightened sages obsessed with the nutritional properties of the tubers that managed to persuade a reluctant and conservative populace to adopt the potato.

But Earle has her doubts. It was peasants who adapted the potato to Europe, she argues, thus they needed no persuading. Elites did not discover a new crop, but rather, they had a novel idea of what healthy food was. Instead of placing a “superfood” in the middle of European diet, they realised that nutrition needed to take a more central role and looked around for those crops that might serve their purpose. The humble tuber was already there.

Enlightened discussions of “population”, and what its health meant for the power of the state, changed political calculations during the 18th Century, and also the fortunes of the potato. If a strong, numerous population was crucial for economic production and military might, the state needed to understand and manage the nutritional components of what people were eating. Abundant, healthy food became central to Empire-building, Earle writes in her 2018 paper Promoting Potatoes in Eighteenth-Century Europe. Thus, she argues, the fascination with potatoes does not come from the emergence of a new crop, but from novel European ideas of the relationship between food and the state.

In this regard, the potato was unrivalled. “The food produced by a field of potatoes is… much superior to what is produced by a field of wheat,” wrote Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations. “No food can afford a more decisive proof of its nourishing quality, or of its being peculiarly suitable to the health of the human constitution.” But while Smith was right in highlighting the potato’s virtues, it was peasants and not the elites that made potatoes a fixture of European gardens and farms.

A question of measuring arises, Earle admits. How did scholars like Smith and his contemporaries compare nutritional value? In the 18th Century, scientists hadn’t agreed on a language for vitamins, proteins and minerals, she said. Instead, “what they did is say: ‘look at the people who eat potatoes. They are more robust, and they are stouter and more energetic than people who eat other things’,” said the scholar, who heads the Department of History at the University of Warwick.

But as she argues, potatoes served this state-building purpose not only because of their nutritional value, but because they were already planted in gardens and fields across the continent. Its fans praised its virtues.

Potatoes, by feeding rapidly growing populations, permitted a handful of European nations to assert dominion over most of the world

They were not wrong. A widely cited economics paper reviewed information from military records of French soldiers born after 1700 and showed that eating potatoes made people slightly taller. According to The Quarterly Journal of Economics: for villages that were fully suitable for potato cultivation, its introduction increased average adult heights by approximately one-half inch.

That same paper provides a stronger claim: that population in Europe and Asia exploded after the spread of the potato. According to the researchers, the tuber introduction accounts for close to one-quarter of the growth in Old World population and urbanisation between 1700 and 1900.

“Potatoes, by feeding rapidly growing populations, permitted a handful of European nations to assert dominion over most of the world between 1750 and 1950,” wrote McNeill.

Back to the Andes

The potato frenzy continued unstoppably until a blight paved the way for the Great Famine of 1845-1849 in Ireland. The failure of the crop, compounded by the utterly inadequate response by the British Government in London (which decided against relief and bet on market forces), led to the death of a million people, the emigration of one million people to the US and the steady departure of two more million elsewhere. Ireland’s population was halved in a matter of decades.

The Famine called attention to the fact that potato had supplied 80% of calorie intake in the country with only a handful of crop varieties available. Such a homogenous food block made the potato susceptible to diseases, as its genetic diversity had been washed away from domestication.

To be fair, some mixing of varieties had already taken place in Europe around the 1750s. Burbano was part of a team that peered into the genes of European potatoes to study their ancestry and concluded that ancient Andean varieties mixed with tubers later brought from the lowlands of south-central Chile, such as Chiloé island, were naturally domesticated for the long days of the Southern Hemisphere.

This first admixture only provides some handy traits, but not enough genetic depth, so breeding programmes over the years have been looking at ways to improve food security for potato farmers. “One of the ways breeders used to incorporate resistance was looking at wild potatoes,” Burbano explained, talking about inedible potato cousins that still survive in the Andes and in the rest of their natural range. There are 151 known species, and they are the ancestors of today’s potatoes, which have lost genetic diversity after centuries of serving humans.

In the early decades of the 20th Century, scientists began combining genes from mainstream potatoes, hoping to keep their domesticated traits, with wild potatoes, hoping to get their resistance to diseases. Most tubers grown today are a result of such tests.

These wild species might also provide an answer to another pressing issue: changing temperature and rain conditions due to the climate crisis. A recent study concluded that rising emissions could cause a reduction of up to 26% of global tuber yield reductions by 2085. Genetic resources from these species could provide desirable traits, such as tolerance to frost, drought or temperature increase.

Breeders in Europe and the United States, and more recently in Asia, have been developing these more resistant varieties for years, paving the way for potatoes to become a truly global crop in the 20th Century. Of the world’s top 20 tuber producers, only three (the United States, Peru and Brazil) are part of its historical range, but every country is creating its own connection to it.

In China, the government is aggressively promoting the potato among its population, hoping it can become a new national staple crop and staple food. Its leaders are following similar tactics to those of 18th-Century Europe, peddling it with state-owned media, popular figures and popular science books. And in India, potatoes are prepared in hundreds of different ways and you would struggle to convince farmers that they aren’t local.

Half the world around, the potato has reignited long-standing rivalries between Peru and Chile over who can claim the tuber as their own, while top chefs in Lima and the Andes – such as Virgilio Martinez who opened Mil in 2019 – are turning their gaze again to potatoes and featuring them in their creations.

While Peruvians insist that potatoes were domesticated in what’s now their territory (and bits of neighbouring Bolivia), a Chilean minister countered in 2008 that a vast majority of the world’s tubers come from a variety introduced from Chile. But the debate is not necessarily about a history lesson, but also about national pride. “The silly part is that the story of the potato began millennia before the concept of nation-states existed,” said Charles Crissman, a researcher at the International Potato Center, in a New York Times story published in 2008. “But, yes, the first potatoes came from what is today Peru.”

The claims rankled Peruvians because it came during the International Year of the Potato in 2008, a celebration that even FAO conceded “came from the Government of Peru”. The country established the International Potato Center in 1971 and worked with indigenous communities in the mountain peaks to protect the potato’s genetic heritage.

A small agri-park high in the Peruvian Andes, the Potato Park in Cusco harbours a living museum of the humble tuber, in their natural environment, a reminder of where the potato comes from, but also a roadmap of where it could go: genetic material from less domesticated potatoes can trace a path forward for the crop, as it deals with new threats such as changing climates and pressures on the agricultural sector.

A two-hour drive east of Cusco, a different view of the present and the future awaits: it’s Mil, an ambitious take on Peruvian culinary tradition perched 12,000ft up in the clouds of the Andean mountains. Thanks to its celebrated chefs, here you can try a handful of Peru’s almost 5,000 species of potatoes, and still have some space to wonder about what’s beyond these mountains: is it an Indian curry? Fish and chips in an east London pub? A baked potato fresh from an Idaho oven?

With the global versatility of potatoes, the possibilities are endless.

“It’s grown practically everywhere in the world, and practically everywhere, people consider it one of ‘our foods’.”For the rest of the world beyond the Andes, the potato might not be autochthonous, but it feels local.
How could an Andean tuber persuade the world, in just a few centuries, to adopt it so completely?
“No crop produced more food per acre, demanded less cultivation and stored as easily as the potato,” wrote sociologist James Lang in his book Notes of a Potato Watcher.

249,Victory gardens: A war-time hobby that’s back in fashion,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200524-victory-gardens-a-war-time-hobby-thats-back-in-fashion,['Ellie Howard'],"It was late March when the UK lockdown was first announced. Around the same time, I ordered a seedling tray and two packets of “Cut ‘n’ Come Again” leafy greens: arugula, rucola, oriental mustard, pak choy and borecole. Nearly two months later, lockdown still hasn’t been lifted, but my tufty lettuce leaves have shot up. For billions, globally, the Covid-19 pandemic has spelt a period of deep uncertainty and stagnation, but watching green miracles occur in my vegetable patch has been reassuring. I’m not alone in thinking so.

The early weeks of the pandemic threw the global supply chain into disarray, setting off a wave of stockpiling. The US saw a spike in alternative milk sales, Australia lacked flour on supermarket shelves, pasta was scarce in Italy and eggs in Britain. Many countries reported fears of labour shortages for perishables such as fresh vegetables, according to Time magazine. As with any crisis, people have been quick to take matters into their own hands – as highlighted by soaring seed sales.

• A British feast from garden weeds

• The dish that ended the plague

• A dish born from the bomb

A recent report by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows 42% of Britons have taken to gardening to cope with lockdown, while a third of a million searched for tips on growing garden variety crops on the Royal Horticultural Society website – the most popular being the humble potato. Across the UK and beyond, people are digging in their backyards, potting plants on balconies or using windowsills as suntraps for seedlings.

The rush to grow-your-own has sparked comparisons to ‘victory gardening’. Dug either side of the Atlantic, from North America to Great Britain and further afield in Australia, these kitchen gardens became popularised in World War One and World War Two when shortages reached critical levels in the Allied nations. In response, governments coordinated domestic campaigns calling upon citizens to fuel the war effort and feed the country. Working the soil became a patriotic duty.

In the UK, most widely remembered is the “Dig for Victory” campaign launched by the British Ministry of Agriculture in 1939. It was so successful that the number of allotments grew to 1.7 million in just three years, while private gardens with vegetable produce numbered five million.

Food prices are going up, and fresh produce is going to be at a premium

During the same period, a horticultural magazine paraphrased Napoleon’s claim that the English were a nation of shopkeepers, instead writing: “We might with equal justice be called a nation of gardeners”. The claim stuck. Our obsession with gardening stretches far beyond a national pastime; it is rooted in the British psyche. The garden is considered a private sanctuary but also a site of creative expression and personal pride, as reflected in the highly competitive British annual “giant vegetable” competitions that spring up from Harrogate to Carmarthenshire. For Britons, growing our own produce has the added value of bringing locals together.

Victory gardens were also not just about food: cultivating fruit and vegetables boosted morale and built momentum. Growing for the greater good banded together communities and enabled those stuck at home to play a part, however small. Perhaps this is why the gardens’ legacy can still be felt today. While using the analogy of war to describe a viral pandemic is controversial, it makes sense that we‘ve connected the two moments in time. It is the sense of community spirit we want to revive – and a victory garden quite literally says we are in this together.

Beyond caring for our own families, green-fingered types are sharing produce with their neighbours. A survey commissioned by the British charity RSA cited that 42% of respondents feel the outbreak has made them value food more, and 10% have shared supplies for the first time.

I first noticed the neighbourly potential of plants three weeks after lockdown had begun, when a neighbour I hardly knew knocked on the door of my house in Suffolk. When I answered, she leapt behind the gate: “Alpine strawberries,” she yelled, “Plant them in partial shade”. A week later, a trio of pepper seedlings appeared – another gift. To say thank you, I delivered fat garlicky leaves of wild ransom, foraged between bluebells in a nearby woodland. Now, we swap excited texts about her egg-laying tortoise, Rosie. Since then, I check what Jeanie and her husband, John, would like from the shops; why I waited for a pandemic to do this is beyond me.

Outside their gate, a sign offers willowherb and more wild strawberries – anything surplus they don’t need. “If someone likes something in your garden, you can just take a cutting for them,” John said. “It doesn’t cost you anything.”

The Bristol Seed Swap has been promoting the circular economy of seed saving for years. A few days after lockdown, they advertised leftover seed packets from a previous event, which the public could request free of charge by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope. Diane Holness, a spokesperson for the non-profit, said swells of gardeners were in touch with requests. “We sent seeds to around 150 people,” she said. “I think everyone is aware that food prices are going up, and that fresh produce is going to be at a premium.”

The most requested seeds were tomato; adaptable and easy to grow. “I think they are one crop that can fit into even the tiniest space, even a balcony,” she said.

Luckily, the organisation had plenty. As Holness said, harvesting seeds costs you nothing, but goes a long way to helping someone else: “If you know how, you could almost save enough cabbage seeds for everyone in the city.”

Two hours west of Bristol, West Dorset’s foodie capital, Bridport, has been a hive of activity since lockdown. Created in response to quarantine, the Bridport Grow Your Own community Facebook group has played a large role in greening the town. Just as the 1930s Dig for Victory leaflets relayed growing information, online groups are helping new growers by circulating plant wisdom.

“As a town, I think we are all at it,” environmentalist and educator Kim Squirrel told me. “People have dug up their gardens and others are growing in pots.” She works a private allotment on the town’s edge, shared between 10 houses, that includes her neighbour Rachel Millson. Both have turned their full attention to growing with news of the lockdown. Squirrel’s potager garden is crammed with brassicas alongside beans, French to dwarf, winding up bamboo stalks that are also home-grown. Pear and espalier apple trees will fruit come the summer.

Millson’s garden exploits are equally impressive: overwintering crops such as earthy beetroot, onion and leeks fill up one plot. Another bed is an experiment in perennial vegetables, such as asparagus, that take less carbon from the soil.

“The pandemic has cemented in my mind the need to be growing more food, not just for my own family and to save money, but for the wider community,” Millson said.

She feels fortunate to have an allotment, but wishes there was more recognition that growing your own food isn’t just a pastime but “real, important work”. Millson strongly believes it has personal benefits and also aids community wellbeing. Pre-empting that food inequality is going to be at an all-time high, she has purposefully grown extra vegetable crops with a mind to donate them to a local foodbank.

Part of the fun of growing your own produce is in sharing your hard-earned bounty with family and friends. But while delivering your overzealous courgette crop is practical, there is something special in giving someone a plant they can cultivate themselves.

We have common ground now, something other than the fear around the pandemic

Bruno White had just moved to Ditcheat, Somerset, when the UK went into lockdown on 23 March. He wrote to his new neighbours to introduce himself and set up an informal mutual aid group. One elderly gentleman he shopped for was so grateful that he left a collection of plants on White’s doorstep, each with handwritten instructions. Shortly afterwards, another thankful neighbour gifted him packets of biodynamic seeds: “He taught us about Three Sisters. It's a traditional Native American method. You grow corn, then beans to climb up it, then squash to shade and stifle any weeds.”

White has since been cultivating his garden and has been surprised at how easy it is – and how kind his neighbours are. “We have common ground now, something other than the fear around the pandemic,” he said.

While the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic were filled with panic, hopefully it will be the incredible displays of neighbourly spirit that we will remember. The victory garden movement of the World Wars not only helped strengthen communities, but also gave home-bound individuals a chance to contribute to those fighting on the front line. Amid a pandemic, the vegetable garden has similar appeal: it offers a sustainable solution to food security that not only helps us, but allows us to care for our neighbours too.

At a time of uncertainty and confusion, even planting a lettuce seed can offer a semblance of hope.

254,Spain’s mysterious mummies,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200528-the-guanches-spains-mysterious-mummies,"['Fernando Teixeira', 'Izabela Cardoso']","The Canary Islands’ subtropical climate, aquamarine waters and otherworldly volcanic and desert landscapes led more than 15 million people to visit the archipelago last year. The islands are considered the southernmost region of Spain, with their easternmost point located just 100km west of Morocco. But long before the first Spanish settlers arrived to the islands in the 1470s, another civilisation was already thriving there: the Guanches.

The Guanches’ origins have long been debated and speculated by archaeologists and historians. Some theorise they were descendants of the Celts, or perhaps the Vikings. Others believe they could even be descended from the mythical inhabitants of Atlantis. A 2019 study of the DNA from ancient mummies from the islands, however, revealed they were most likely Berbers from North Africa, who arrived there around 100AD or even earlier.

This media cannot be played on your device.

How exactly the Guanches reached the archipelago remains unclear. One theory suggests they crossed in small vessels, landing in the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. And although the number of settlers also remains a mystery, studies estimate that 14 couples would have been enough to populate the archipelago.

Archaeological studies suggest the Guanches were organised in a tribal society, where chieftains or kings ruled almost absolutely. They relied on farming, hunting and gathering, and their diet included milk, goat, pork and fruits. They mainly dressed in goat-skin leather tunics and vests made of plaited rushes and lived in caves or simple low-stone houses.

They adapted caves and grottoes to be used as silos and temples. Some of those structures have been preserved to this day and indicate the Guanches’ sophisticated astronomical knowledge: holes on the caves’ walls allowed sunlight in at certain positions during different times of the year, marking solstices and equinoxes.

One of the most noteworthy of those structures is Risco Caído, a settlement that consists of 21 caves excavated on a volcanic tuff about 100m high above the Barraco Hondo River in the island of Gran Canaria. The site is believed to have been used as a silo, a temple and a place for astronomical observation, with holes that allowed sunlight and moonlight to enter the caves and illuminate symbolic drawings on the walls. In 2019, Risco Caído became the first Unesco World Heritage site in the Canary Islands.

260,A mysterious US desert civilisation,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200521-a-mysterious-us-desert-civilisation,['Smoke'],"In the heart of the San Juan Basin, in the arid north-western corner of New Mexico, stands one of the greatest ancient treasures in the US: the remarkably preserved remains of a vast building complex believed to have been constructed between 850 and 1250AD that may have housed as many as 5,000 people. The high desert area of Chaco Canyon sees cold winters, scorching-hot summers and only about 22cm of rainfall every year. Yet, it was home to a thriving, yet mysterious, civilisation – the Chacoans, ancestors of the Puebloans.

In 1907, this isolated 53sq-mile expanse of desert became a national historical park, containing 13 major ruins and more than 400 archaeological sites. Pueblo Bonito, the largest excavated site, covers about 2 acres and has roughly 800 rooms arranged in a D-shaped building. The site was designed with sophisticated irrigation systems, the doorways are perfectly aligned with each other to facilitate communication and researchers estimate it housed about 2,000 people.

Today, visitors can wander around the same maze of chambers and roads used by its residents roughly 1,000 years ago. Some of the structures used to create the roofs and different floors are long gone, but their remains clearly reveal how they were built. Approximately 200,000 wooden pillars were used in the construction and were most likely hand-carried from the Chuska Mountains and Mount Taylor, more than 112km away.

The Chacoan roads are another impressive feature of the complex. There are about 650km of them, some 9m wide, built mostly in straight lines that cut through the rough topography instead of going around it. Their positioning, starting at a central structure and running towards notable natural elements, such as lakes and mountains, suggests they represented symbolic connections between man and nature. Yet, it doesn’t mean they weren’t practical: studies have shown that walking on those roads is less tiresome than walking on the rough terrain next to them.

Over the years, archaeologists have come up with different theories for why Chaco was built. Although the place seems to have been a trade hub, the buildings suggest it may also have been an important ceremonial site and point to the Chacoans’ impressive astronomical knowledge. The walls are aligned with the axis of the sunrise on an equinox and the north doorway faces almost exactly true north. Contemporary New Mexico Pueblo tribes, such as the Zuni, still consider Chaco Canyon a sacred site and they return there for ceremonies.

Since 1987, the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, along with other smaller Chaco sites, is a Unesco World Heritage site. For the past few years, one of the biggest threats to the site has been the oil and gas drilling and mining around Chaco Canyon. In 2019, the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act was introduced to the US Senate – if it passes, it will ban those activities within a 16km radius of the site.

266,Riz au lait: A simple French dish made from pantry staples,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200520-rice-pudding-a-simple-french-dish-made-from-pantry-staples,['Emily Monaco'],"Almost the moment that lockdown was announced in France, chefs started posting recipes for French comfort food desserts on Instagram, hoping to spread a bit of sweetness among their fellow citizens. But while crepes, yogurt cake and madeleines all certainly emerged, the recipe to feature most frequently, from the feed of Michelin-starred Stéphanie le Quellec to those of renowned pastry chefs Christophe Michalak and Yann Couvreur, was the humble riz au lait (rice pudding) – a custard-like dessert made by slowly cooking rice with milk and sugar.

A global comfort food While rice pudding exists in various forms around the globe, its very first apparition is hazy: some attribute it to China, while others point to the Indian subcontinent. East Asian iterations include simple sweet congee or the aptly named “eight treasures” steamed pudding, flavoured with a variety of fruits and sweet bean paste. In India, meanwhile, kheer has been enjoyed since ancient times, associated with Hindu god Shiva and with Ayurvedic therapies. Today, nearly every culture around the world has its own version: baked or boiled, spiced or sweetened with fruit. Latin American arroz con leche is often made with condensed milk and spices; in Indonesia, black glutinous rice is the base for bubur ketan hitan. In Scandinavia, tradition even demands that a bowl be left out for mischief-making Christmas elves.

“It’s really a childhood dessert in French culture,” said Marine Gora, co-founder of Gramme restaurant in Paris. “I’d say everyone probably has a childhood memory associated with riz au lait.”

According to culinary historian Patrick Rambourg, riz au lait has long featured on French tables – if not specifically as a comfort food dessert, or even a dessert at all. While riz au lait recipes date as far back as the 14th Century, the concoction, then often made with broth (or almond milk on lean days when the Catholic Church forbade meat and dairy), was usually served to the bedridden or ailing thanks to its nourishing qualities and digestibility. But above all, riz au lait was generally a dish served to the aristocracy.

“Rice was still rare, at that time,” said Rambourg. “Very rare. And so, it was mainly eaten by the rich.”

It was probably because of this association with the upper crust that riz au lait soon took on a sweeter profile, seasoned with saffron and sugar – both of which were rare and expensive, at the time.

By the 16th Century, however, rice began to become more common in France – and in Europe in general – and riz au lait thus started to appear on more modest tables, notably among peasants in the French countryside, albeit only for holiday meals. When beet sugar became popular in France in the 19th Century, thereby making it a more commonplace sweetener even on modest tables, riz au lait slowly but surely became something that those from all walks of life could enjoy, from a simple dessert sweetened only with sugar to more elaborate riz à l’impératrice with candied fruits and alcohol.

The idea of riz au lait being a childhood dessert, then, is one that appeared “very recently,” Rambourg said. As for how exactly that came to be, the waters are murky. Perhaps it comes from the familiarity of its ingredients; perhaps from its digestibility, or the pureness of its white colour, or just from its ease.

But for Rambourg, there’s not one simple answer.

“I think there’s something else behind it… something that isn’t always easy to explain,” he said. “There are recipes that evoke feelings far more than flavour, perhaps.”

While riz au lait is firmly ensconced in the nostalgic, comfort food category of “recettes de grand-mère” (literally, “grandmother’s recipes”), in many French families today, riz au lait is more often eaten out of a store-bought plastic pot than served out of a fancy copper saucepan.

“Often, it’s pretty poorly made,” said Gora. “It’s not creamy, it’s kind of overly compact.”

Some homemade recipes up the ante by folding in whipped cream or egg yolks for richness, while others spice it up with vanilla, cinnamon or caramel. When professional chefs put their hand to the dish, however, it is often to add contemporary textural contrast. Gora’s version calls for caramel-coated puffed rice atop the creamy pudding.

“Whenever you’re building a dish, you always try to look for different textures, so a bit of crunch,” said Gora. “It came to me naturally: the crispy, caramelised rice with a touch of caramel.”

Her recipe is unsurprisingly quite popular among her clients. And while it’s not on her regular menu, patrons make frequent requests for its appearance.

“Whenever anyone asks for it, I always make it the next day!” she said.

Chef Stéphane Jégo, too, opted to include a crunchy caramel topping when he created a version at his 7th-arrondissement Paris restaurant Chez L’Ami Jean 16 years ago. To hear Jégo tell it, he never intended for the riz au lait to remain on the menu quite so long. He was just looking for a nostalgic dessert he could serve that was easy to prepare in advance.

“I wanted something that hearkened back to childhood,” he said, “and to this idea of communal dining.”

His riz au lait has three components: the pudding itself; a creamy caramel made with salted Brittany butter; and house-made nougatine with nuts enrobed in a crunchy caramel coating (see recipe below). Served by the generous bowlful with a wooden spoon, it quickly became the star of Jégo’s menu.

“There’s this regressive side to it, where you get to the end of the meal, and the riz au lait comes, and the first thing everyone says is, ‘Oh, it’s way too much!’,” Jégo said, laughing. “And then it’s just like… oh, one spoon, two spoons, three spoons… and all of a sudden, the bowl is empty.”

Now, Jégo said, he couldn’t take it off the menu, even if he wanted to. “It’s crazy: I get stopped in the street, even abroad, for riz au lait.

“That, to me, is worth all the stars in the world. Because it means you’ve touched people. You’ve got to the heart of what good food can bring to people, and to pleasure, and to memory,” he said.

During confinement, Jégo has prepared 200 litres of riz au lait for hungry Parisians to take away and enjoy at home.

“I don’t really think mine is any better than anyone else’s. It’s the orchestration. The generosity. You’ve got this childlike zeal that just… takes over,” he said, as he stirred the caramel for his most recent batch.

“People just need that comfort.”

Stéphane Jégo’s Riz au Lait Recipe



Rice Pudding

2.5l milk

1 vanilla bean, split

500g short-grain rice

500g sugar

1l cream (Jégo uses Normandy cream)

Heat the milk and the vanilla bean. Add the rice and cook 40 minutes over low heat. When the rice is tender enough to crush between your fingers, add the sugar, and cook 15 minutes more. Remove the vanilla bean and chill the pudding in the fridge.

Whip the cream to medium peaks. Remove the rice from the fridge and use a spoon to break it up and loosen it. Fold in the whipped cream.

Nougatine

250g pistachios

250g walnuts

250g almonds (toasted in the oven with 3 dabs of butter)

125g unsalted butter

190g turbinado sugar

In a saucepan over medium heat, make a light brown caramel with the butter and the sugar. Add the walnuts and the pistachios, and then toss them in the caramel until well coated. Pour everything onto a lined baking sheet containing the toasted almonds, and then set aside to cool.

Salted Caramel

600g heavy cream, plus 25ml for whipping

125g salted butter (Jégo uses Brittany butter)

600g sugar

37g flaky sea salt (Jégo uses fleur de sel)

5½ gelatine sheets, 2g each

In a saucepan over medium heat, make a dark brown caramel with the sugar and the butter. Off the heat, add the cream, sea salt flakes and gelatine. Cook for 30 minutes over low heat. Set aside in the fridge.

Whip the cream to stiff peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into the caramel.

When the nougatine has cooled, break it up into bite-sized pieces. Serve the pudding, caramel and nougatine in serving bowls, so that each diner can assemble his or her own portion.

A blue hat was perched on her head and her short tunic, embroidered with pink geometric designs, was tied sharply at the waist. She pointed at a wooden structure made of round logs, raised high above the ground on stilts.

“We caught the bears as cubs and raised them as a member of the family. They shared our food and lived in our village. When the time came, we set one free back into nature and killed the other to eat.”

Having treated the bear well in life, her people believe the spirit of the sacred animal, which they worship as a deity, will ensure the continued good fortune of their community.

Kimiko Naraki is 70 but looks decades younger. She is Ainu, an indigenous people who now live mostly on Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island, but whose lands once spanned from northern Honshu (the Japanese mainland) north to Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands (which are now a disputed part of the Russian Federation). The Ainu have long been of interest to anthropologists because of their cultural, linguistic and physical identity, but most travellers will not have heard of them. That’s because although they were the earliest settlers of Hokkaido, they were oppressed and marginalised by Japanese rule for centuries.

The Ainu have had a difficult history. Their origins are murky, but some scholars believe they are descendants of an indigenous population that once spread across northern Asia. The Ainu called Hokkaido “Ainu Moshiri” (“Land of the Ainu”), and their original occupation was hunting, foraging and fishing, like many indigenous people across the world. They mainly lived along Hokkaido’s warmer southern coast and traded with the Japanese. But after the Meiji Restoration (about 150 years ago), people from mainland Japan started emigrating to Hokkaido as Japan colonised the northernmost island, and discriminatory practices such as the 1899 Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act displaced the Ainu from their traditional lands to the mountainous barren area in the island’s centre.

“It’s a very ugly story,” said Professor Kunihiko Yoshida, law professor at Hokkaido University.

Forced into agriculture, they were no longer able to fish for salmon in their rivers and hunt deer on their land, Yoshida said. They were required to adopt Japanese names, speak the Japanese language and were slowly stripped of their culture and traditions, including their beloved bear ceremony. Due to the wide stigmatisation, many Ainu hid their ancestry. And the long-term effects are clear to see today, with much of the Ainu population remaining poor and politically disenfranchised, with much of their ancestral knowledge lost.

Among other nefarious practices, Japanese researchers ransacked Ainu graves from the late 19th Century to the 1960s, amassing huge collections of Ainu remains for their study and never returning the bones.

Recently, however, things have started to look up for the Ainu. In April 2019, they were legally recognised as an indigenous people of Japan by the Japanese government, after many years of deliberation, which has resulted in a more positive appreciation of Ainu culture and renewed pride in their language and heritage.

""It is important to protect the honour and dignity of the Ainu people and to hand those down to the next generation to realise a vibrant society with diverse values,"" said government spokesman Yoshihide Suga, as reported in The Straits Times.

Naraki continued showing us around the Ainu kotan (village). Still smiling, she pointed to a wooden, cupboard-like structure. “This is the toilet for the men,” she said, giggling. Next to it was a smaller, teepee-style hut. “And this one is for the women.”

I want to tell the world that Japan has indigenous people

Naraki leads tours of this kotan to teach visitors about her culture. It is part of the Sapporo Pirka Kotan (Ainu Culture Promotion Centre), Japan’s first municipal facility featuring indigenous people, where visitors can experience Ainu handicrafts, watch traditional dancing and imagine traditional Ainu life when this area was a vast wilderness and the people lived on and with the land. Located approximately 40 minutes by car from downtown Sapporo, Hokkaido’s capital city, the centre was opened in 2003 to teach both other Japanese and foreign visitors about Ainu culture and spread their message to the world.

“97% of Ainu are underground. But the people who come here to events are very proud of their culture,” said Jeffry Gayman, an educational anthropologist at Hokkaido University who has been working with the Ainu for 15 years.

The pride is especially evident in the centre’s small, well-kept museum, where Ainu artefacts, such as traditional clothing and tools, are carefully displayed. Upstairs are rooms where visitors can join workshops on Ainu embroidery or learn how to make the traditional Ainu musical instrument mukkuri (a bamboo mouth harp). By hosting events, members of the community are able to educate the wider world on their history and situation.

“If I try to tell people about Ainu rights and empowerment, no-one is interested. But when people see our dancing or music, it makes them interested in learning more about us,” explained Ryoko Tahara, an Ainu activist and president of the Ainu Women’s Association.

Although this centre is a significant step in sharing Ainu culture nationally and internationally, no-one lives here. The kotan is a replica to show people what traditional Ainu life was like. Only a few isolated neighbourhood pockets of Ainu people remain, scattered across Hokkaido, with most of the estimated 20,000 Ainu (there are no official figures) assimilated into cities and towns around the island.

However, travellers who look carefully will be able to see traces of their culture everywhere. Many place names in Hokkaido have Ainu origins, such as “Sapporo”, which comes from the Ainu words sat (dry), poro (large) and pet (river) due to its location around the Toyohira River; or “Shiretoko” – a peninsula that sticks out from Hokkaido’s north-eastern tip – which can be translated as “of the ground” (siri) and “protruding point” (etuk).

And Ainu pride is visible at events like the annual Marimo Festival at Lake Akan and the Shakushain festival in Shizunai; and in groups like The Ainu Art Project, a 40-member group that share Ainu culture through their Ainu and rock fusion band and handmade arts and crafts. Restaurants such as Kerapirka in Sapporo serve up traditional Ainu food and act as a hub for the local community.

“And you can see Ainu values in any settings where Ainu people gather, whether that be inside their home, at a local town gathering or an event. But you need to know what you’re looking for,” said Gayman, explaining that “generosity and hospitality” are core Ainu principles. “They’re light-hearted people,” he said.

The Ainu have also become more prominent on the national stage, with activist Kayano Shigeru elected to the Japanese parliament in 1994, where he served five terms; and the hugely popular manga series, Golden Kamuy, pushing Ainu culture into the national spotlight over the last couple of years.

“In the last few years, people have become more interested in the Ainu; it has become a hot topic in Japan,” said Tahara. “That makes me proud that people will know about the Ainu, but there is still work to be done.”

The latest step forward for this community is the Symbolic Space for Ethnic Harmony in Shiraoi, Hokkaido, a new complex currently under construction by the government to showcase Ainu culture. Made up of a National Ainu Museum, the National Park for Ethnic Harmony and a memorial facility, it was scheduled to open in April 2020 in time for the Olympics, but has been delayed due to Covid-19.

The recognition is very symbolic, but not so meaningful

However, many experts believe that the recent recognition of the community is not enough, saying it is merely lip-service by the government, with the new Ainu bill failing to provide Japan’s indigenous people with clear and strong rights.

“The Ainu still cannot fish their salmon and dams are still being built that submerge sacred sites,” said Yoshida. “There’s no self-determination, no collective rights and no reparations. It’s just a cultural performance.”

“The recognition is very symbolic, but not so meaningful,” he added with a sad laugh, noting that Japan is far behind the world standard in treatment of indigenous people. “It’s a shameful situation. That’s the reality.”

As I followed Naraki on her tour of the kotan, it seemed clear, however, that public interest in Ainu culture is strong. Groups of Japanese people and other visitors, who’d arrived by bus-load from Sapporo, jostled for pictures in front of the pu, the hut for storing food, which is located directly opposite the poro-ci-set, where the village chiefs lived in order to keep a stern eye on the village’s communal larder. “The elders would resolve any disputes in the village,” Naraki said. If no one could agree, they would discuss for three days and three nights and then make a decision.

She explained how the Ainu’s lives were tied to the land. Kotans would be constructed along rivers or by the sea where water was plentiful and safe from natural disasters. Food was foraged or hunted, with staple proteins including salmon, deer and bear. They would pick wild grasses, vegetables, mushrooms and berries, such as kitopiro (Alpine leek) and shikerepe (berries of the Amur cork tree), never picking everything at once and always leaving the roots so the plants could keep growing. Food was simple, with animal oil, kelp and salt the only flavourings, and millet their main grain. Clothes were made with animal or fish skin, or woven with tree bark or nettle fibres.

Living in harmony with nature is a way of life that many Ainu would like to return to. “Eventually what I want is to get back some land so we can hunt and fish freely as well as do our traditional farming,” Tahara told me. Increasing numbers of Ainu are also starting to relearn their language, which is linguistically isolated and declared as critically endangered by Unesco.

What are your other hopes for the future, I asked Tahara.

“I want to tell the world that Japan has indigenous people. People don’t know,” she said. “I want us all to respect each other, to treat each other respectfully and live peacefully in this country. And, of course, I would like our ancestors’ bones returned. Bring them back to the graves they were taken from.”

277,The secret to a long and healthy life? Eat less,https://bbc.com/future/article/20170601-the-secret-to-a-long-and-healthy-life-eat-less,['Alex Riley'],"Eating less certainly seemed to help the monkeys, but calorie restriction is much tougher for people out in the real world. For one, our access to regular, high-calorie meals is now easier than ever; with companies like Deliveroo and UberEats, there is no longer a need to walk to the restaurant anymore. And two, gaining weight simply comes more naturally to some people.

“There’s a huge genetic component to all of this and its much harder work for some people than it is for others to stay trim,” says Anderson. “We all know someone who can eat an entire cake and nothing happens, they look the exact same. And then someone else walks past a table with a cake on it and they have to go up a pant size.”

Ideally, the amount and types of food we eat should be tailored to who we are – our genetic predisposition to gaining weight, how we metabolise sugars, how we store fat, and other physiological fluxes that are beyond the scope of scientific instruction at the moment, and perhaps forever.

But a predisposition to obesity can be used as a guide to life choices rather than an inevitability. “I personally have a genetic history of obesity running through my family, and I practice a flexible form of caloric restriction,” says Susan Roberts a dietary scientist at Tufts University in Boston. “I keep my BMI at 22, and [have calculated] that that requires eating 80% of what I would eat if my BMI was at 30 like every other member of my family.” Roberts stresses that it isn’t hard – she follows her own weight management programme using a tool called iDiet to help her eat less but avoid feeling hungry or deprived of enjoyment. If this wasn’t possible, she adds, she wouldn’t practise calorie restriction.

Not only has Roberts seen the problems of obesity first-hand in her family, she knows the benefits of CR better than most. For over 10 years she has been a leading scientist in the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy trial, also known as Calerie. Over two years, 218 healthy men and women aged between 21 and 50 years were split into two groups. In one, people were allowed to eat as they normally would (ad libitum), while the other ate 25% less (CR). Both had health checks every six months.

Unlike in the Rhesus monkey trials, tests over two years can’t determine whether CR reduces or delays age-related diseases. There simply isn’t enough time for their development. But the Calerie trials tested for the next best thing: the early biological signs of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.

Published in 2015, the results after two years were very positive. In the blood of calorie-restricted people, the ratio of “good” cholesterol to “bad” cholesterol had increased, molecules associated with tumour formation – called tumour necrosis factors (TNFs) – were reduced by around 25%, and levels of insulin resistance, a sure sign of diabetes, fell by nearly 40% compared to people who ate their normal diets. Overall, the blood’s pressure was lower.","And two, gaining weight simply comes more naturally to some people.

Two-year-old Emile Ouamouno had been fond of playing inside the tree, which was near his home in Meliandou – a village in the heart of the Guinean jungle. But other life had also discovered its cosy confines: bats. Children would sometimes catch them there, before roasting them for dinner.

Then Emile got sick. On the 28 December 2013, he succumbed to a violent and mysterious illness. His mother, sister and grandmother were next. And that was it – after the funeral, the disease gradually began to spread.

By 23 March 2014, there had been 49 cases and 29 deaths – and scientists confirmed that it was Ebola. Over the next three and a half years, the world looked on in horror as the virus claimed more than 11,325 lives. But while this was going on, another tragedy was unfolding.

Across the city, swathes of eminent men were succumbing to sickness, and practically all of them were dying. The losses were as baffling as they were alarming.

Then one day, a slave approached a curule aedile – a kind of magistrate – and hinted that she might know why. The girl led a team of investigators to various houses, where she claimed they would find an alliance of upper-class women secretly preparing poisons. They did.

The accused were dragged to the central square, and asked to prove their innocence. Since they claimed their concoctions were medicinal, would they drink them?

Alas, two of the suspects obliged – and promptly dropped dead. Mass arrests followed, and a further 170 women were found to be involved. The incident was a huge scandal. In the aftermath, the people of Rome elected a dedicated official to perform a ritual banishment of evil, a tactic which had previously only been used as a last resort after extreme civil unrest.

Or, at least, this is the version of events that was dutifully recorded by the respected historian Livy, who was born a few hundred years later. But he wasn’t convinced that the women were really responsible, and neither are modern-day experts. Instead, Livy pointed to a far more rational explanation: an epidemic.

At the time, the city was in the grip of an unknown plague – a common cause of death in the classical world. Mass poisonings, on the other hand, were unheard of. The case discussed by Livy was the first of its kind, and the whole affair had struck Roman citizens as distinctly odd.

In fact, the women probably really were preparing medicines – and the rest of the story was heavily embellished or entirely made up. The infamous poisonings of 331 BC are thought to be a conspiracy theory, to explain deaths that had an obvious cause all along.

In the UK, people have been standing on their doorsteps every Thursday evening during the Covid-19 outbreak to applaud health workers. To me it feels as though the ritual is coming around more frequently, which is nice in one way because it is an opportunity to say hello to the neighbours, but disconcerting nonetheless because the weeks feels as though they are flashing by. Journalists from the US to Poland have also been contacting me to ask why time seems to have sped up during the crisis, so it seems I’m not alone.

One reason is that we create our own subjective experience of time in our minds and it doesn’t always match up with what we read on the clock or the calendar. A 20-minute lunch with a friend goes by in a flash, while a 20-minute wait for a delayed train can feel interminable, yet in reality of course the duration is identical.

You might also like:

We estimate time passing in two ways: prospectively (how fast is time passing right now?) and retrospectively (how fast did last week or the last decade go by?).

During lockdown, those isolated from friends, family and work have had long days to fill. People have found all sorts of inventive ways to pass the time – baking bread, planting seeds, creating video call quizzes – but inevitably when you spend every day and every evening at home, the days begin to feel a little similar. Some people have found they haven’t even been distinguishing between weekdays and weekends. (Read more about how lockdown has redefined our weekends.)

This blurring of identical days leads us to create fewer new memories, which is crucial to our sense of time perception. Memories are one of the ways that we judge how much time has passed. When you go on holiday for a week to a new place, the time goes fast while you’re away because everything is new, but when you get home, you look back and have made so many new memories that it often feels as though you’ve been away for far longer than a week.","As parts of the world begin to ease their lockdowns, some people are looking back and finding the time in isolation seems to have gone surprisingly fast.

295,How staying indoors affects your immune system,https://bbc.com/future/article/20200521-can-staying-inside-weaken-the-immune-system,['Linda Geddes'],"For the past two months, a sizable chunk of the world’s population has been shuttered inside their homes, only stepping out for essential supplies. Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.

Humans evolved on a planet with a 24-hour cycle of light and dark, and our bodies are set up to work in partnership with sunlight. One of the most obvious examples of this is the production of vitamin D in the skin in response to UVB exposure. This daily dose of vitamin D can help to strengthen our bones and teeth, but it also has an effect on our immune cells.

Vitamin D enables the macrophages in our lungs – a first line of defence against respiratory infections – to spew out an antimicrobial peptide called cathelicidin, killing bacteria and viruses directly. It also tweaks the activity of other immune cells, such as B and T cells, which orchestrate longer-term responses. People with low levels of vitamin D are at greater risk of viral respiratory tract infections such as influenza.

Researchers are now investigating whether vitamin D supplements could even reduce the risk of some of the severe complications associated with Covid-19. Earlier this month, Rose Kenny, a gerontologist at Trinity College Dublin, and her colleagues published data suggesting that European populations with the highest death rates from Covid-19, including Spain and Italy, have the lowest levels of vitamin D. This may sound counterintuitive, given their sunny climates, but it is thought that changes in lifestyle have led people to spend more time indoors, which combined with greater use of sunscreen in these countries, may be responsible for the lower levels of vitamin D.","Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.

South Africans will be able to buy alcohol from Monday for the first time in two months, as the government eases one of the toughest lockdowns in the world.

The alcohol ban was introduced to enable the police and hospitals to better focus on tackling the coronavirus.

Alcohol can now be sold from Monday to Thursday only for consumption at home.

The ban was introduced at the start of the lockdown in order, above all, to free up hospital beds. And also to reduce domestic violence.

Alcohol-fuelled violence is a huge problem in South Africa, particularly at weekends.

Doctors and police say the ban has had a dramatic impact, contributing to sharp drop in casualty admissions.

But the country’s brewers and its wine makers have complained that they’re being driven out of business. And the government has lost a fortune in tax revenues.

South Africa is easing some lockdown restrictions, hoping to revive its economy at a time when the infection rate is starting to rise.

Cape Town is currently experiencing a sharp spike, and other major cities are expected to follow suit.

The country is also grappling with a serious shortage of testing equipment.

South Africans will be able to buy alcohol from Monday for the first time in two months, as the government eases one of the toughest lockdowns in the world.

The alcohol ban was introduced to enable the police and hospitals to better focus on tackling the coronavirus.

Alcohol can now be sold from Monday to Thursday only for consumption at home.

The ban was introduced at the start of the lockdown in order, above all, to free up hospital beds. And also to reduce domestic violence.

Alcohol-fuelled violence is a huge problem in South Africa, particularly at weekends.

Doctors and police say the ban has had a dramatic impact, contributing to sharp drop in casualty admissions.

But the country’s brewers and its wine makers have complained that they’re being driven out of business. And the government has lost a fortune in tax revenues.

South Africa is easing some lockdown restrictions, hoping to revive its economy at a time when the infection rate is starting to rise.

Cape Town is currently experiencing a sharp spike, and other major cities are expected to follow suit.

The country is also grappling with a serious shortage of testing equipment.

A lawyer for the family of George Floyd, whose death sparked unrest across the US, has accused a police officer of ""premeditated murder"".

Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder, but lawyer Benjamin Crump told CBS news it was a case of first-degree murder.

""We think that he had intent... almost nine minutes he kept his knee in a man's neck that was begging and pleading for breath,"" he said.

Several US cities have imposed curfews.

The Floyd case has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement.

""The fact that officer Chauvin kept his knee on his neck for almost three minutes after he was unconscious. We don't understand how that was not first degree murder. We don't understand how all these officers haven't been arrested,"" lawyer Crump said.

Three other officers present at the time have also since been sacked.

For many the outrage over George Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socioeconomic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself.

In video footage, Mr Chauvin, 44, can be seen kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for several minutes on Monday. Mr Floyd, 46, repeatedly says that he is unable to breathe.

There have been five nights of arson and looting in Minneapolis and the adjacent city of St Paul. Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said on Saturday he was deploying the full Minnesota National Guard for the first time since World War Two.

The National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - said on Sunday that 5,000 of its personnel had been activated in 15 states and Washington DC. It added that ""state and local law enforcement agencies remain responsible for security"".

In the CBS interview, lawyer Benjamin Crump also said ""we now have the audio from the police bodycam and we hear where one officer says 'he doesn't have a pulse, maybe we should turn him on his side', but yet officer Chauvin says 'no, we're going to keep him in this position'. That's intent.

The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.

George Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Footage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor.

Mr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.

The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far.

It began with a report of a fake $20 (£16.20) bill.

A report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.

Believing the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police.

Mr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC.

But Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.

In a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but ""he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that"", according to a transcript released by authorities.

The employee said the man appeared ""drunk"" and ""not in control of himself"", the transcript says.

Shortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.

After approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.

Mr Lane, prosecutors said, ""put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car"". Then Mr Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed"".

Once handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for ""passing counterfeit currency"".

It was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued.

At around 20:14, Mr Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic"", according to the report.

Mr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.

During this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd out of the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said.

He lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.

That's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last.

Mr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.

""I can't breathe,"" Mr Floyd said repeatedly, pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"".

For eight minutes and 46 seconds, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors' report says.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Derek Chauvin is due to appear in court in Minneapolis on Monday

About six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.

One of the other officers, JA Kueng, did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but ""couldn't find one"". Yet, the officers did not move.

At 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance.

He was pronounced dead around an hour later.

On the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.

Forgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.

""The way he died was senseless,"" Harris said. ""He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.""","The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes.

Thousands of people have gathered across central London to protest against the killing of an unarmed black man by police in the US.

They held up signs saying ""Justice for George Floyd"", who died in police custody while an officer kneeled on his neck to pin him down.

Derek Chauvin has been charged with his murder in Minneapolis. The white police officer has been sacked from his job.

Some protesters appeared to be breaking lockdown rules, not staying 2m apart.

The protests have been held at Trafalgar Square and outside the US Embassy in Battersea.

Elsewhere in the UK, hundreds marched through Manchester city centre chanting ""Black Lives Matter"".

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The protesters chanted ""black lives matter"" and ""say my name, George Floyd""

The same chanting could be heard in London and the US, in reference to the civil rights campaign group. They also held up placards saying ""racism has no place"", and ""I can't breathe"" - a reference to Mr Floyd's words during his arrest.

The Met Police said officers were present and were engaging with those in attendance.

It added that an ""appropriate policing plan is in place"".

Reverend Sally Hitchiner, associate vicar at St Martin-in-the-Fields church on Trafalgar Square, said she could see hundreds gathered for the protest from her workplace.

""I'm very sympathetic to the issue but also surprised to see the strength of emotion that has gathered people together,"" she said.

""Clearly they're not following lockdown and social distancing, but I think there's a huge amount of passion there and that's overriding their concerns.

""It's an issue that requires passion but at the same time there's a huge amount of risk in what they're doing.""

She said police appeared to be moving the crowd on from the square by early afternoon.

73,Coronavirus: India to loosen lockdown despite record cases,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52862160,[],"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Coronavirus: Death and despair for migrants on Indian roads

India has announced plans to further ease a strict national lockdown even as the country reported a record daily rise in new coronavirus cases.

From 8 June, restaurants, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship will be allowed to re-open in many areas in the first stage of a three-phase plan.

Weeks later, probably in July, schools and colleges will resume teaching.

But areas with high numbers of Covid-19 cases will remain under tight lockdown.

The plan comes after India registered a new record single-day rise in confirmed infections, with nearly 8,000 cases reported on Saturday.

In total India has recorded some 174,500 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths. The nation of 1.3 billion has been hit less hard by the coronavirus than many other countries.

It went into a strict lockdown more than two months ago when the confirmed caseload was in the hundreds. Official data suggests the decision prevented the loss of between 37,000 and 78,000 lives.

However the cost to the economy has been high and pictures of millions of informal workers leaving cities for their rural villages after losing their jobs - some of them on foot - shocked the country.

Health officials say that they are able to further lift the lockdown in many places because most cases have been restricted to urban areas in a handful of states.

More than 80% of the active cases are in five states - Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh - and more than 60% of the cases are in five cities, including Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad, according to official data.

As part of the three-phase plan:

Shopping centres, places of worship, hotels, restaurants and other hospitality services will open from 8 June (guidelines will be released to ensure social distancing)

School and colleges may open later - possibly in July - after consultations with states

International travel, metro services, cinemas, sporting events and gyms will be allowed to restart in an undated third phase but this will depend on ""the situation""

A night curfew will remain in place but shorten by two hours - from 21:00-05:00 instead of 19:00-07:00

These measures will not apply to designated ""containment zones"" where the virus is believed to be transmitting at a higher rate. Such zones are at the district or neighbourhood level.

The city of Mumbai, India's financial capital. in Maharashtra state, has one of the highest numbers of containment zones, reports suggest. Hospitals there are struggling to cope with an influx of virus patients.

The reported infection rate - the number of infections for every 100 tests - in Maharashtra is three times the national average.

People will be restricted from moving between containment zones and non-containment zones but there will be no restriction on general inter-state travel, the government says.","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Coronavirus: Death and despair for migrants on Indian roadsIndia has announced plans to further ease a strict national lockdown even as the country reported a record daily rise in new coronavirus cases.

75,India coronavirus: Why is India reopening amid a spike in cases?,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52808113,[],"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Within a week of reopening, India has seen a sharp spike in cases

India is roaring - rather than inching - back to life amid a record spike in Covid-19 infections. The BBC's Aparna Alluri finds out why.

On Saturday, India's government announced plans to end a national lockdown that began on 25 March.

This was expected - the roads, and even the skies, have been busy for the last 10 days since restrictions started to ease for the first time in two months. Many businesses and workplaces are already open, construction has re-started, markets are crowded and parks are filling up. Soon, hotels, restaurants, malls, places of worship, schools and colleges will also reopen.

But the pandemic continues to rage. When India went into lockdown, it had reported 519 confirmed cases and 10 deaths. Now, its case tally has crossed 173,000, with 4,971 deaths. It added nearly 8,000 new cases on Saturday alone - the latest in a slew of record single-day spikes.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fast food chains like McDonald's have begun reopening outlets in parts of India.

So, why the rush to reopen?

The lockdown is simply unaffordable

""It's certainly time to lift the lockdown,"" says Gautam Menon, a professor and researcher on models of infectious diseases.

""Beyond a point, it's hard to sustain a lockdown that has gone on for so long - economically, socially and psychologically.""

From day one, India's lockdown came at a huge cost, especially since so many of its people live on a daily wage or close to it. It put food supply chains at risk, cost millions their livelihood, and throttled every kind of business - from car manufacturers to high-end fashion to the corner shop selling tobacco. As the economy sputtered and unemployment rose, India's growth forecast tumbled to a 30-year-low.

Raghuram Rajan, an economist and former central bank governor, said at the end of April that the country needed to open up quickly, and any further lockdowns would be ""devastating"".

The opinion is shared by global consultant McKinsey, whose report from earlier this month said India's economy must be ""managed alongside persistent infection risks"".

""The original purpose of the lockdowns was to delay the spike so we can put health services and systems in place, so we are able handle the spike [when it comes],"" says Dr N Devadasan, a public health expert. ""That objective, to a large extent, has been met.""

In the last two months, India has turned stadia, schools and even train coaches into quarantine centres, added and expanded Covid-19 wards in hospitals, and ramped up testing as well as production of protective gear. While grave challenges remain and shortages persist, the consensus seems to be that the government has bought as much time as possible.

""We have used the lockdown period to prepare ourselves… Now is the time to revive the economy,"" Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said last week.

The silver lining

For weeks, India's relatively low Covid-19 numbers baffled experts everywhere. Despite the dense population, disease burden and underfunded public hospitals, there was no deluge of infections or fatalities. Low testing rates explain the former, but not the latter.

In fact, India made global headlines not for its caseload but for its botched handling of the lockdown - millions of informal workers, largely migrants, were left jobless overnight. Scared and unsure, many tried to return home, often desperate enough to walk, cycle or hitchhike across hundreds of kilometres.

Perhaps the choice - between a virus that didn't appear to be wreaking havoc yet, and a lockdown that certainly was - seemed obvious to the government.

But that is changing quickly as cases shoot up. ""I suspect we will keep finding more and more cases, but they will mostly be asymptomatic or will have mild symptoms,"" Dr Devadasan says.

The hope - which is also encouraging the government to reopen - is that most of India's undetected infections are not severe enough to require hospitalisation. And so far, except in Mumbai city, there has been no dearth of hospital beds.

India's Covid-19 data is spotty and sparse, but what it does have suggests that it hasn't been as badly hit by the virus as some other countries.

The government, for instance, has been touting India's mortality rate as a silver lining - at nearly 3%, it's among the lowest in the world.

But some are unconvinced by that. Dr Jacob John, a prominent virologist, says India has never had, and still doesn't have, a robust system for recording deaths - in his view, the government is certainly missing Covid-19 deaths because they have no way of knowing of every fatality.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Indians are venturing out again but its unclear how many of them are asymptomatic.

And, he says, ""what we must aim for is flattening the mortality curve, not necessarily the epidemic curve"".

Dr John, like several other experts, also predicts a peak in July or August, and believes the country is reopening so quickly because the ""government realised the futility of such leaky lockdowns"".

A shift in strategy

So is the government gearing up for another lockdown when the peak comes?

While Dr Menon believes the lockdown was well-timed, he says it was too focused on cases coming from abroad.

""There was a hope that by controlling that, we could prevent epidemic spread, but how effective was our screening [at airports]?""

Now, he adds, is the time for ""localised lockdowns"".

The federal government has left it to states to decide where, how and to what extent to lift the lockdown as the virus' progression varies wildly across India.

Maharashtra alone accounts for more than a third of India's active cases. Add Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Delhi, and that makes up 67% of the national total.

But other states - such as Bihar - are already seeing a sharp uptick as migrant workers return home.

""Initially, most of your cases were in the cities,"" Dr Devadasan says. ""But we kept the migrant workers in cities and didn't allow them to go home. Now, we are sending them back. We have facilitated transporting the virus from urban areas to rural areas.""

While the government has said how many infections have been avoided - up to 300,000 - and lives saved - up to 71,000 - by the lockdown, there is no indication of what lies ahead.

There is only advice: The day the government began to ease restrictions, Mr Kjeriwal tweeted, urging people to ""follow discipline and control the coronavirus disease"" as it was their ""responsibility"".

Because the alternative - of curfews and constant policing - is unsustainable.

""My worry is more the circumstances of people - it's not as though they have an option to practise social distancing,"" Dr Menon says.

And they don't - not in joint family homes or one-room hovels packed together in slums, not in crowded markets or busy streets where jostling is second nature, or in temples, mosques, weddings or religious processions where more is always merrier.

US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have docked with the International Space Station (ISS).

Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - edged them into port on the high-flying lab's bow section.

The men will have to wait for leak and pressure checks to be completed before they can disembark and join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS.

Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday.

It was the first time since the retirement of the shuttles nine years ago that the US space agency has sent up astronauts from home soil.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""Go Nasa, go SpaceX. God speed Bob and Doug""

The mission marks the beginning of a new era in which Nasa will be purchasing transport services from the commercial sector. No more will it own and operate the vehicles that run to and from the station.

This will be done, as in this case, by firms like California's SpaceX outfit, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST), slightly ahead of schedule, 422km (262 miles) above the border between northern China and Mongolia.

It was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach.

SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans.

Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers.

SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn contract which will see six crew ""taxi"" flights occur, with the first likely at the end of August.

When Hurley and Behnken enter the ISS they will claim the Stars and Stripes flag left on the platform by the members of the very last shuttle mission in 2011.

Earlier, the two astronauts named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it ""Endeavour"", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s.

Mining giant Rio Tinto has apologised for blowing up 46,000-year-old Aboriginal caves in Western Australia dating back to the last Ice Age.

The Juukan Gorge caves, in the Pilbara region, were destroyed last Sunday as Rio Tinto expanded an iron ore project agreed with the authorities.

Many prehistoric artefacts have been found at the remote heritage site.

""We are sorry for the distress we have caused,"" said Chris Salisbury, the firm's iron ore chief executive.

""We pay our respects to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura People (PKKP),"" he said. The PKKP are the traditional owners of the site.

""We will continue to work with the PKKP to learn from what has taken place and strengthen our partnership. As a matter of urgency, we are reviewing the plans of all other sites in the Juukan Gorge area.""

Artefacts found there include a belt made from human hair, analysis of which showed a direct link going back 4,000 years between the PKKP and the prehistoric cave-dwellers.

'Devastating blow'

""Today we also recognise that a review is needed in relation to the management of heritage in Western Australia more broadly,"" Mr Salisbury said.

Besides iron ore, the Anglo-Australian giant has many mining interests in Australia, including bauxite for aluminium, diamonds and uranium.

Last week a PKKP representative, John Ashburton, said losing the site was a ""devastating blow"".

""There are less than a handful of known Aboriginal sites in Australia that are as old as this one... its importance cannot be underestimated,"" Reuters news agency quoted him as saying.

""Our people are deeply troubled and saddened by the destruction of these rock shelters and are grieving the loss of connection to our ancestors as well as our land.""

The number of coronavirus fatalities in Brazil has risen by almost 1,000 in a day, making the country's overall death toll the world's fourth highest.

Its figure of 28,834 has now surpassed France, and only the US, the UK and Italy have recorded more deaths.

President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently played down the outbreak, although the country has the world's second-highest number of cases.

He has criticised state lockdowns for harming Brazil's economy and jobs.

What are the latest figures?

Brazil's health ministry said the past 24 hours had seen 956 new deaths.

This puts it past France's total of 28,774. Even if new figures raised the French total back above Brazil, the trends in the two countries show deaths in the Latin American nation are on a far steeper upward trend.

According to a count by Johns Hopkins University, Brazil now has 498,440 confirmed cases.

Only the US has more, with 1.77 million.

The number of deaths in Brazil has been doubling roughly every two weeks, compared to about every two months in the UK, four months in France, and five months in Italy.

Experts have warned that the real figure may be far higher due to a lack of testing.

Will this change Brazil's policies?

Mr Bolsonaro is unlikely to alter his stance, arguing that the economic fallout of lockdowns is worse than the outbreak.

He has fought what he calls ""the tyranny of total quarantine"" by state governors - despite the upward tick in cases - and has even called for Brazil's football season to resume.

He has also been seen mingling with hundreds of supporters in Brasilia while not wearing a face mask.

""We call on the Holy Spirit to grant light and strength to the Church and to society in Amazonia, which has been harshly tested by the pandemic,"" he said.

Amazonas state has one of Brazil's highest infection rates and also one of the most underfunded health systems.

Many experts believe Central and South America are now the major hotspots for increased infections.

South Africans will be able to buy alcohol from Monday for the first time in two months, as the government eases one of the toughest lockdowns in the world.

The alcohol ban was introduced to enable the police and hospitals to better focus on tackling the coronavirus.

Alcohol can now be sold from Monday to Thursday only for consumption at home.

The ban was introduced at the start of the lockdown in order, above all, to free up hospital beds. And also to reduce domestic violence.

Alcohol-fuelled violence is a huge problem in South Africa, particularly at weekends.

Doctors and police say the ban has had a dramatic impact, contributing to sharp drop in casualty admissions.

But the country’s brewers and its wine makers have complained that they’re being driven out of business. And the government has lost a fortune in tax revenues.

South Africa is easing some lockdown restrictions, hoping to revive its economy at a time when the infection rate is starting to rise.

Cape Town is currently experiencing a sharp spike, and other major cities are expected to follow suit.

The country is also grappling with a serious shortage of testing equipment.

A Belgian prince has contracted coronavirus after attending a party during lockdown in Spain, the country's royal palace says.

Prince Joachim, 28, travelled from Belgium to Spain for an internship on 26 May, the palace said.

Two days later, he went to a party in the southern city of Córdoba, before testing positive for Covid-19.

Spanish reports suggest the prince, a nephew of Belgium's King Philippe, was among 27 people at the party.

Under Córdoba's lockdown rules, a party of this size would be a breach of regulations, as gatherings of no more than 15 people are currently permitted.

Spanish police have launched an investigation into the party. Those found to have flouted lockdown rules could be fined up to €10,000 (£9,000; $11,100).

Everyone who attended the party is said to be in quarantine. Prince Joachim, the youngest son of Princess Astrid and 10th in line to the Belgian throne, is said to have mild coronavirus symptoms.

Rafaela Valenzuela, a representative of the Spanish government in Córdoba, condemned the party, calling those who attended ""irresponsible"".

""I feel surprised and angry. An incident of this type stands out at a moment of national mourning for so many dead,"" she said.

The party was first covered by Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, which cited a document from the Andalucian authorities but did not name the prince.

Belgian media have since confirmed with the palace that Prince Joachim was in Spain, where he remains.

The prince is known to have a long-standing relationship with a Spanish woman, reported to be Victoria Ortiz.

South Africans will be able to buy alcohol from Monday for the first time in two months, as the government eases one of the toughest lockdowns in the world.

The alcohol ban was introduced to enable the police and hospitals to better focus on tackling the coronavirus.

Alcohol can now be sold from Monday to Thursday only for consumption at home.

The ban was introduced at the start of the lockdown in order, above all, to free up hospital beds. And also to reduce domestic violence.

Alcohol-fuelled violence is a huge problem in South Africa, particularly at weekends.

Doctors and police say the ban has had a dramatic impact, contributing to sharp drop in casualty admissions.

But the country’s brewers and its wine makers have complained that they’re being driven out of business. And the government has lost a fortune in tax revenues.

South Africa is easing some lockdown restrictions, hoping to revive its economy at a time when the infection rate is starting to rise.

Cape Town is currently experiencing a sharp spike, and other major cities are expected to follow suit.

The country is also grappling with a serious shortage of testing equipment.

A Belgian prince has contracted coronavirus after attending a party during lockdown in Spain, the country's royal palace says.

Prince Joachim, 28, travelled from Belgium to Spain for an internship on 26 May, the palace said.

Two days later, he went to a party in the southern city of Córdoba, before testing positive for Covid-19.

Spanish reports suggest the prince, a nephew of Belgium's King Philippe, was among 27 people at the party.

Under Córdoba's lockdown rules, a party of this size would be a breach of regulations, as gatherings of no more than 15 people are currently permitted.

Spanish police have launched an investigation into the party. Those found to have flouted lockdown rules could be fined up to €10,000 (£9,000; $11,100).

Everyone who attended the party is said to be in quarantine. Prince Joachim, the youngest son of Princess Astrid and 10th in line to the Belgian throne, is said to have mild coronavirus symptoms.

Rafaela Valenzuela, a representative of the Spanish government in Córdoba, condemned the party, calling those who attended ""irresponsible"".

""I feel surprised and angry. An incident of this type stands out at a moment of national mourning for so many dead,"" she said.

The party was first covered by Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, which cited a document from the Andalucian authorities but did not name the prince.

Belgian media have since confirmed with the palace that Prince Joachim was in Spain, where he remains.

The prince is known to have a long-standing relationship with a Spanish woman, reported to be Victoria Ortiz.

Gunmen on motorbikes fired into the crowded market in Kompienga town around lunchtime on Saturday, eyewitnesses and residents said.

It is unclear who was behind the attack, but Burkina Faso has seen a recent sharp rise in jihadist violence and inter-communal clashes.

Amazon has blamed a ""bad actor"" for racist abuse that appeared on multiple listings on its UK website.

The abuse, now removed, appeared when users searched the online shop for Apple AirPods and similar products.

It was unclear how long the racist language remained on the site, but it sparked outrage on Twitter and the sharing of screenshots and video grabs.

Amazon told the BBC that it removed the images and took action against the ""bad actor"" as soon as the issue was raised.

The company did not elaborate on the ""bad actor"", nor give details of how many products were defaced and how long the abuse was visible on the listings.

Nadine White, a journalist for the Huffington Post, tweeted that the abuse ""needs to be acknowledged, removed, explained, apologised for asap. Being Black right now is hard enough; we don't need to be called the N- word while shopping online, to boot"".

Another Twitter user said Amazon should have been able to remove the offending messages in minutes. ""They're still on Amazon UK. Extraordinarily poor site administration,"" he said during early hours of Sunday.

Amazon also allows third-party retailers to sell goods through its website, with the company making about half its retail revenues from this.

But the Amazon Marketplace platform has come under scrutiny.

There has been concern about counterfeit goods appearing in the listings, and during the coronavirus pandemic Amazon was criticised for not doing enough to stop sellers inflating prices.

In April, five Amazon e-commerce websites, including the UK, were added to the US trade regulator's ""notorious markets"" report on marketplaces known for counterfeiting and piracy concerns.

Amazon disagreed strongly with the move, saying in a statement that ""this purely political act is another example of the administration using the US government to advance a personal vendetta against Amazon"".","Image copyright Getty ImagesAmazon has blamed a ""bad actor"" for racist abuse that appeared on multiple listings on its UK website.

97,"Coronavirus: UK exceeds 200,000 testing capacity target",https://bbc.com/news/uk-52869875,[],"Image copyright PA Media

The UK has exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May.

Some 205,634 tests were available on Saturday, the government confirmed.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock described it as ""an important milestone on our journey to control the spread of the virus"".

It comes as another 113 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus.

It takes the total number of people who have died after testing positive to 38,489.

While capacity for testing is over 200,000, a little more than 115,000 tests were carried out in the 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Sunday.

For several days, the government has been unable to give figures on the exact number of people who were tested.

The UK now has capacity for 40,000 antibody tests a day, the Department for Health and Social Care confirmed.

The tests, which determine whether someone has had the virus, are currently only available to health and care staff.

The capacity figure also includes tests being sent out to a random cross-section of society by statisticians, as well as those conducted on people actually displaying symptoms.

In early May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his ""ambition"" was to reach capacity to conduct 200,000 tests a day by the end of the month ""and then go even higher"".

Do we have enough tests?

At the start of the coronavirus outbreak the UK's limited testing capacity was soon overwhelmed by the number of new infections.

Lockdown had to quickly be imposed to stop the virus spreading and overwhelming the NHS.

Testing capacity has been ramped up significantly in recent weeks.

As of 29 May, 127,722 coronavirus tests were carried out. The bulk were community swab tests for people concerned about symptoms and wanting to know if they have the virus.

Although rates of the infection have decreased substantially with lockdown, the virus has not disappeared from society.

People can still catch it, and experts believe 8,000 a day in England currently are.

As lockdown eases, a new system called test and trace is being used to help keep the virus under control - identifying possible outbreaks.

Having enough tests on offer will be vital, as well as getting rapid results back so people can find out if they might have the virus and therefore need to stay at home to stop the spread.

Widespread testing forms a central part of the government's strategy to control the virus.

England's test and trace system, which kicked off on Thursday, aims to enable a move from blanket lockdown restrictions towards more targeted measures.

Meanwhile, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick urged people who were shielding to ""only do what you are comfortable with"" as he confirmed that vulnerable people in England will be able to go outdoors again from Monday.

Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, he urged people to continue to follow the social distancing guidelines, acknowledging that some people ""will be very cautious"".

He also said the government would now review the risks to the clinically extremely vulnerable as part of each review of the lockdown measures, with the next due on the week beginning 15 June.

Officials will consider the next steps of the shielding programme ""more generally"" beyond June 30, but Mr Jenrick insisted the advice would be ""tightened"" if ""conditions become less favourable"".

The government in Wales has announced that outdoor exercise for people shielding will be unlimited from Monday, but the advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed.","Image copyright PA MediaThe UK has exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May.

99,Brothers' Home: South Korea's 1980s 'concentration camp',https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-52797527,"['Bugyeong Jung', 'Bbc Korean']","Han Jong-sun still clearly remembers the moment he was abducted with his sister.

It was a beautiful autumn day in 1984, and Han, then eight years old, was enjoying a long-hoped-for trip to the city with his busy father.

But Han's father still had a few errands to run, and he decided the quickest - and safest - thing to do would be to leave the children with an officer at a police substation for a few minutes.

That police officer would tear the family apart.

""A bus stopped in front of the police substation and we were forced into the bus,"" Han recalls more than 30 years later. ""A police officer exchanged unknown signs with the people who got off the bus.

""We had no idea where we were taken to. 'Daddy told us to wait here! Daddy is coming!' We cried and bawled.

""They started beating us, saying that we were too loud.""

The bus was taking them to Hyungje Bokjiwon, a private facility that was officially a welfare centre.

But in reality, allege those who survived, it was a brutal detention centre which held thousands of people against their will - some for years on end.

Warning: Some readers may find some of these details upsetting

According to testimonies and evidence gathered from the site, detainees say they were used as slave labour at construction sites, farms, and factories during the 1970s and 80s. They were also allegedly tortured and raped, with hundreds dying under the inhumane conditions.

The facility at Hyungje Bokjiwon has been compared to a concentration camp, but its story is not widely known, and nobody - to this day - has been held accountable for the atrocities that reportedly happened within its walls.

For Han and his sister, their arrival was the start of a nightmare which would last three and a half years, and forever change the course of their lives.

'Social Purification Projects'

In the 1980s, South Korea was booming economically. It had achieved incredible growth, overcoming the scars of the Korean War in the 1950s, after which the Korean peninsula was split into North and South.

The whole country was in a fever ahead of the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and the government began spurring on the nation's rebranding efforts.

But behind the so-called ""Miracle of Han River"" was a brutal and dark reality.

In April 1981, a letter arrived at the office of then-Prime Minister Nam Duck-woo. The letter, handwritten by President Chun Doo-Hwan, a former general who had seized power through a military coup a year earlier, ordered the authorities to ""crack down on begging and take protective measures for vagrants"".

Under the ordinance which allowed arbitrary detention of vagrants, social welfare centres were set up and buses with signs that read ""Vagrants' Transport Vehicle"" began to appear in large cities like Busan.

These welfare centres, mostly private facilities, were given subsidies from the government based on the number of people they took care of. Meanwhile, police are said to have been rewarded for ""purifying"" the streets by sending people to these centres.

Rough sleepers, disabled people, some orphan children, and even ordinary citizens who just failed to show their identification when asked, were allegedly taken to the centres as part of the ""Social Purification Projects"".

Hyungje Bokjiwon was one of the biggest of these welfare centres, not that far from a residential area in the south-eastern port city of Busan. The owner, Park In-guen, often insisted that they were there to feed, clothe and educate the vagrants.

On paper, each of the people who arrived at these centres should have only been kept inside for a year, given training and then released back into society.

The reality is that, for many, the next time they would see their friends and family again was in 1987, when the centres were forced to close after more than 30 escaped inmates blew the whistle on what was really happening behind their walls.

'Prison life'

Choi Seung-woo, another Hyungje Bokjiwon survivor, was 13 when he was taken off the streets on his way home from school.

""A police officer asked me to stop and started searching my bag,"" he told the BBC. ""There was half a loaf of bread, a leftover of my lunch which was given from school.

""He asked where I stole the bread from. He tortured me, burning my genitals with a lighter. He kept beating me, saying he wasn't going to let me go unless I confessed to the 'crime'.

""Just wanting to go home, I lied. 'I stole it, I stole it. Please let me go…'""

About 10 minutes after he says he was forced to confess to a crime he did not commit, a freezer dump truck arrived, and he was forced inside. Choi says that was the start of his ""prison life"".

He spent almost five years in Hyungje Bokjiwon, in which time he says he saw - and experienced - brutal sexual and physical violence.

To keep control of the inmates, he says, the centre was arranged like an army. Choi was placed in a platoon, under the command of another inmate who had risen to become a platoon leader, given authority to ""educate others"" and tacitly allowed to use physical force.

""The platoon leader and some other guys took all of my clothes off and poured a bucket of cold water on my body.

""While I was trying to sleep, shivering naked, the platoon leader came again and raped me. He did that to me for three consecutive nights until I was transferred to a different platoon.""

It took Choi just a week to realise that ""people are being killed here"".

""I saw a guy wearing a white robe dragging an inmate across the floor,"" he says. ""He seemed dead. He was bleeding all over his body. His eyes were rolling back. The white robe guy didn't care at all and just kept dragging the man to somewhere.

""A few days later, a guy showed some sort of resistance by asking the platoon leader some forbidden questions like 'Why are we trapped in here? Why should we be beaten?'

""Four people came and rolled him in a blanket. They kicked him all over his body until he fainted, foaming at the mouth. People took him out wrapped. He never returned to the centre. I knew that he died.""

More stories from South Korea

Aged just eight when he arrived, Han says he was the youngest in his platoon and was usually given manual work, like folding envelopes or making toothpicks.

He described the facility as ""hell"".

""The only thing I was provided from the centre was a set of blue training suits, rubber shoes, and a piece of nylon underwear.

""I rarely had a chance to take a shower. Lice were all over my body. We had rotten fish and stinking barley rice every day, literally every day. Almost all of the inmates were malnourished.

""Four people slept in zigzags on a small bed. Rape occurred every night in the corner of the dormitory.""

Some people dreamt of an escape, he says, adding that some even tried running away, but it was almost impossible to get past the guards and jump over a 7m (23ft)fence.

If you tried, failure was not an option.

""I knew that if I failed to escape, I would be beaten to death,"" Han said.

The mutual monitoring system made escape more difficult. Han says that sometimes mass escape was planned secretly, but there were always whistleblowers.

Prof Park Sook-kyung, of Kyung Hee University, who took part in a recent investigation into what happened at Hyungje Bokjiwon, pointed out the rule under which managers selected platoon leaders and gave them privileges helped maintain the whole detention system.

""The platoon leader I met said he had mixed feelings about what happened in the past. He said he saw himself as a bastard, but he did that to survive.

""If someone escaped, the platoon leader had to be punished instead.""

Some parents tried to get their children back. Choi's family searched everywhere for their beloved son.

Choi says his family tried filing missing persons reports for him and his brother, who had also been taken to the centre, but police simply ignored them.

By the mid-1980s, rumours started spreading in Busan about people being beaten to death inside the so-called welfare centre.

Confident that his children were kidnapped and trapped in the facility, Choi's father knocked on the door of Hyungje Bokjiwon. His protest led the centre managers to release the brothers in 1986.

A year later, Park In-guen, who ran Hyungje Bokjiwon, was arrested. The centre was forced to close.

Life after release was not easy though.

Choi says his life was like that of a ""beast"". His brother took his own life in 2009.

""I was still a vagrant in the eyes of the society. I could only live a life of a vagrant, a beast. No-one held out their hands for us. We were branded by the state and the people followed. Whenever I said I was in Hyungje Bokjiwon, people were afraid of me.""

Han, meanwhile, had lost contact with his sister and his father, who had also ended up in the centre.

Eventually, in 2007, he found them being treated in hospital for the mental trauma inflicted during their years at the centre.

Waiting for justice

A report into the centre by the then-opposition party published in 1987 found more than 500 detainees died under the inhumane treatment during the 12 years in which Hyungje Bokjiwon was in operation.

But nobody has ever been held to account for their deaths, nor the alleged human rights abuses which took place.

Park was eventually sentenced to two and a half years in prison only for embezzlement of state subsidies. He died of natural causes in 2016.

Two years later, the prosecutor who led the initial investigation into Hyungje Bokjiwon confessed that ""there was external pressure by the military government to stop the investigation... and demand a short sentence for Park"".

That same year, the then-prosecutor general Moon Moo-il formally apologised for the initial failures and requested that the Supreme Court review the ruling against Park, admitting that ""no proper investigation was carried out"".

Han has never given up hope of a proper investigation: he has been protesting in front of the South Korean national assembly since 2012, demanding a state inquiry into Hyungje Bokjiwon. Choi joined him in 2013. Earlier this month, Choi staged a rooftop protest and was later taken to a hospital. He's still attending psychotherapy sessions regularly.

There is some hope, though: a new report by the Busan city government, seen by BBC Korean, clearly shows that Hyungje Bokjiwon was not the welfare centre it claimed to be.

Every one of the 149 former inmates - including a ""platoon leader"" - who took part in a survey said they were held by force. A third of them have a disability, and more than half failed to receive a proper education.

The team behind the report, Prof Park says, also believes ""there was a torture room hidden inside Park In-guen's office"".

The report also shows Park's centre benefited from the systematic segregation policy supported by the Chun administration during the 1980s.

There are now signs those locked up in Hyungje Bokjiwon may finally get the justice they have waited so long for: on 20 May, the South Korean National Assembly passed a bill, ordering the allegations be looked at again.

The next day, President Moon Jae-in, who took part in the investigation in 1987 as a member of Busan District Bar Association, said that he was ""always sorry for failing to properly reveal the truth at that time"", ordering a fresh investigation.

It has given Han a sliver of hope. He has even stopped his protest in front of the national assembly.

""I've always questioned myself. 'Did I really do something wrong to be taken to the hell-like facility?' If so, was it that grave that my whole life should be destroyed?

""I don't think I could forgive the government and the people related for letting it happen. However, if they succeed in revealing what really happened in the facility and make an official apology for the victims, I would try to forgive. I will try.

""My only wish is for my family to be reunited like in the past when I was an eight-year-old boy who just loved to play with daddy and sister.""

101,In mid-Pacific with nowhere to land,https://bbc.com/news/stories-52852377,"['Rebecca Henschke', 'Bbc World Service']","Image caption Nova on board the Arka Kinari

A group of performers were halfway across the Pacific Ocean in a 75ft sailing boat when the coronavirus pandemic erupted. Suddenly countries began closing their sea borders - leaving the vessel with no guarantee of a safe haven before the start of the typhoon season.

When the crew of the Arka Kinari left Mexico on 21 February they, like everyone else, were aware of the coronavirus. They had no idea, though, how soon it would affect them and how seriously. They say they joked about it being just a Mexican beer. But approaching Hawaii six weeks later, they picked up a radio signal.

As their boat sliced through the waves, they clustered on the foredeck around the tiny radio, intently listening to a crackled voice announcing that Pacific islands, such as the Cook, Christmas and Marshall Islands, were all closing their borders.

""This really brought it home to us that the whole world was really shutting down,"" says British crew member Sarah Louise Payne.

Image caption The Arka Kinari

They had set out from the Netherlands in August - two musicians with a multinational seven-person crew, including lighting and sound engineers, heading for Indonesia, the country they planned to make their base.

Grey Filastine and his Indonesian partner Nova Ruth had spent years flying around the world performing at music festivals, playing their unique mix of traditional Javanese melodies and contemporary electronic music.

Their lyrics focused on environmental and social justice, and Grey says he and Nova were ""frustrated about our complicity with the very same fossil capitalism that we're denouncing in our performances"".

So they had an idea - to create a multimedia performance on board their boat with a message about the climate crisis and the health of the oceans. Finally, they would have ""a method that matches the message"", Grey says.

The ship would have an engine for emergencies, but they would use it very sparingly. Essentially, it would be carbon-neutral travel. Grey believed it was important for musicians to demonstrate that this was viable: ""We can imagine life after the carbon economy and re-engage with the last great commons, the sea.""

They sold a share in a house in Seattle, and bought the boat. Nova originally wanted to build an Indonesian Pinisi sailing boat, but that would have required large amounts of tropical hardwood so they ended up recycling an old two-masted steel-hulled schooner. The sails double as screens during their performances.

""When we saw it, the two sails were similar to the Pinisi, so it was close to our dream,"" says Nova, whose mother's family are from the Bugis, a seafaring tribe.

""As a descendant of the Bugis I feel sad that I haven't learnt to sail, and very few of my generation do,"" she says. She was also motivated by the fact she has been told that women from the Bugis tribe shouldn't sail, ""so it's become my personal mission to do so"".

Bugis

From the Indonesian island of Sulawesi

Well before the European colonisation of South East Asia and Australia, Bugis sailors are believed to have traded across the region including Australia - their boats are found in ancient Aboriginal rock and bark paintings

Some say that the word ""bogeyman"" refers to the Bugis or Buganese pirates - ruthless seafarers that you wouldn't want to cross

For Sarah it was a perfect gig as she is a sailor and a lighting technician - alongside having ""a great love for this Earth of ours and the need to help protect it"".

Fellow British crew member Claire Fauset joined the expedition after falling in love with ""the crazy plan and the beautiful boat and of course, the zombie apocalypse survival team that is this crew"".

Grey and Nova borrowed money, around £250,000 (€300,000), so at some point the project needs to generate money, either through performances or taking on paying passengers. This has also been put in jeopardy by the coronavirus pandemic.

""Arka Kinari is a massive undertaking, it had already stretched us to the limits, physically, financially, emotionally, and then this happens,"" says Grey.

After rebuilding the 1947 schooner in Rotterdam, crafting and rehearsing the on-board performances in Europe, the Canary Islands, Panama, and Mexico, they were mid-Pacific when the coronavirus outbreak became a pandemic affecting every country in the world.

Grey and one other crew member, both US citizens, could have stayed indefinitely in Hawaii. The others - the Brits, a Spaniard and a Portuguese - got visas for a month, allowing them to restock with fresh food and regain their land legs. Nova had flown home from Mexico to prepare for the ship's arrival.

During their time in Hawaii the rest of the crew monitored the spread of lockdown measures from one country to another. Soon enough, Indonesia announced a ban on all foreign arrivals by sea or air until further notice.

""I got the taste of ashes in my mouth. You could describe that as a personal meltdown,"" says Grey.

Before setting off, they had made a Plan B for just about any eventuality - or so they thought. Their route had doubled in length to avoid piracy off Somalia and the war in Yemen, but the coronavirus was a complete broadside.

""In practical terms our plans would have been less disrupted by World War Three, because at least warring states don't close their borders to the ships of allies,"" says Grey.

On 6 May, with the US visas about to expire, they decided to head for Indonesia anyway hoping that it might open its borders before the start of the typhoon season in June - but with no clear idea where they would go if it didn't.

Before departure they were plagued with doubts and indecision. One crew member decided to bail out at the last minute. For the rest of the crew, with typhoon season bearing down on them, ""we had to put such apprehensive thoughts about borders closing aside,"" says Sarah.

Now, three weeks later, fresh food is running low, but there is enough dry food to last a couple of months. Fresh water is not a problem thanks to solar-powered desalination equipment on the vessel.

They are growing a few spindly lettuces on board as an experiment and catching fish with home-made lines and lures.

Image caption Sarah (left) with fellow crew members Benjamin and Clare

This involved a change in diet for some of the crew. ""Veganism is a great choice on land, where plants grow - but we're on the sea, where the fish live,"" says Grey.

They are now sailing at around 13 degrees latitude, and if they see any circular storm developing they will route south. Worryingly, the navigation system has broken so they are navigating by iPhone.

""While we do have some paper charts, an iPhone is now our most full-featured navigation tool. That might sound pathetic but it's far more information than the Polynesians or Captain Cook had to cross the Pacific,"" says Grey.

If they could stop somewhere with internet, the problem with the main navigation chart plotter might be resolved, Grey says. They also need to anchor somewhere, even an uninhabited atoll, to fix some problems that developed in the rigging.

But they don't know when or where they will next be able to land.

""And as we slowly sail towards Indonesia the worries about landing are eclipsing the worries of the sea,"" says Grey.

At sea, everyone takes turns doing the necessary chores. During the dayshifts they steer the ship and carry out any sailing manoeuvres, enter data into the logbook, monitor the engine and grease the propeller shaft.

The morning shift involves cleaning the solar panels, washing the dishes, swabbing the deck and inspecting the fresh food, while the afternoon is for big infrastructure projects, repairs, wood maintenance and carpentry, de-rusting and painting the steel hull.

And then at night the only responsibility is to keep to the course and look out for hazards. The Arka Kinari doesn't stop.

""It's just you, the heavens above and infinite sea around,"" says Grey.

""On moonless nights your eyes become so light-sensitive that the rise of Venus and other planets casts a reflective path on the sea that we normally only experience from the Sun or Moon.""

Not only can you see the bow wave perfectly illuminated by starlight, he says, but the agitation of the water causes ""trails of bioluminescence, like underwater fireflies or grinder sparks"".

""If I bring the right music along, I can pass the whole two hours of my night watch breathless, in goosebumps.""

Back in Indonesia, Nova has been trying all her contacts to get permission for the Arka Kinari to land, but without success. Grey, as her spouse, might be allowed in, she gets told, but not the rest of the crew.

Recently they passed Johnston Atoll, a US-administered territory once used for testing and storing chemical and biological weapons. They asked for permission to land, but there was no reply.

""Never thought I'd be asking a nuclear waste dump for refuge,"" says Grey. ""Given it has a three-mile security perimeter, we didn't dare get any closer.""

Next try was the Marshall Islands - completely closed.

Along the route ahead are some islands evacuated after contamination by US nuclear tests in the 1950s, which would not be safe to live in permanently, but perhaps safe enough for a short visit.

This could be the only place, Grey thinks, where they might be unnoticed or tolerated, and somewhere they could try waiting for a while.

He points out that barring the boat is irrational, because they have been effectively quarantined at sea.

""Lawmakers didn't consider the fact that we spend weeks at sea in the strictest of quarantine. It's us that are at risk from land-dwellers, not the reverse.""

They are going slowly, intentionally, aiming to reach Indonesian waters in early July, hoping that by then they will be allowed to enter.

If they can't, the Arka Kinari will need to seek refuge from the typhoons elsewhere, preferably a country not far away - if there is one that will have them - from which they can make a dash for Indonesia between typhoons, when borders open.

On the project website they have announced all scheduled performances are suspended. When this crisis finally does come to an end, it states, the Arka Kinari will be ready to begin its role inspiring people through music to build a better future.

112,China-India border: Why tensions are rising between the neighbours,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-52852509,"['Anbarasan Ethirajan', 'Vikas Pandey', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Press Information Bureau Image caption The area has become a hotspot in part because of a road India has built

The armies of the world's two most populous nations are locked in a tense face-off high in the Himalayas, which has the potential to escalate as they seek to further their strategic goals.

Officials quoted by the Indian media say thousands of Chinese troops have forced their way into the Galwan valley in Ladakh, in the disputed Kashmir region.

Indian leaders and military strategists have clearly been left stunned.

The reports say that in early May, Chinese forces put up tents, dug trenches and moved heavy equipment several kilometres inside what had been regarded by India as its territory. The move came after India built a road several hundred kilometres long connecting to a high-altitude forward air base which it reactivated in 2008.

The message from China appears clear to observers in Delhi - this is not a routine incursion.

""The situation is serious. The Chinese have come into territory which they themselves accepted as part of India. It has completely changed the status quo,"" says Ajai Shukla, an Indian military expert who served as a colonel in the army.

China takes a different view, saying it's India which has changed facts on the ground.

Reports in the Indian media said soldiers from the two sides clashed on at least two occasions in Ladakh. Stand-offs are reported in at least three locations: the Galwan valley; Hot Springs; and Pangong lake to the south.

India and China share a border more than 3,440km (2,100 miles) long and have overlapping territorial claims. Their border patrols often bump into each other, resulting in occasional scuffles but both sides insist no bullet has been fired in four decades.

Their armies - two of the world's largest - come face to face at many points. The poorly demarcated Line of Actual Control (LAC) separates the two sides. Rivers, lakes and snowcaps mean the line separating soldiers can shift and they often come close to confrontation.

The current military tension is not limited to Ladakh. Soldiers from the two sides are also eyeball-to-eyeball in Naku La, on the border between China and the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim. Earlier this month they reportedly came to blows.

And there's a row over a new map put out by Nepal, too, which accuses India of encroaching on its territory by building a road connecting with China.

Why are tensions rising now?

There are several reasons - but competing strategic goals lie at the root, and both sides blame each other.

""The traditionally peaceful Galwan River has now become a hotspot because it is where the LAC is closest to the new road India has built along the Shyok River to Daulet Beg Oldi (DBO) - the most remote and vulnerable area along the LAC in Ladakh,"" Mr Shukla says.

India's decision to ramp up infrastructure seems to have infuriated Beijing.

Image copyright AFP Image caption There have been protests in Nepal against India's new road link

Chinese state-run media outlet Global Times said categorically: ""The Galwan Valley region is Chinese territory, and the local border control situation was very clear.""

""According to the Chinese military, India is the one which has forced its way into the Galwan valley. So, India is changing the status quo along the LAC - that has angered the Chinese,"" says Dr Long Xingchun, president of the Chengdu Institute of World Affairs (CIWA), a think tank.

Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia programme at the Wilson Center, another think tank, says this face-off is not routine. He adds China's ""massive deployment of soldiers is a show of strength"".

The road could boost Delhi's capability to move men and material rapidly in case of a conflict.

Differences have been growing in the past year over other areas of policy too.

When India controversially decided to end Jammu and Kashmir's limited autonomy in August last year, it also redrew the region's map.

The new federally-administered Ladakh included Aksai Chin, an area India claims but China controls.

Senior leaders of India's Hindu-nationalist BJP government have also been talking about recapturing Pakistan-administered Kashmir. A strategic road, the Karakoram highway, passes through this area that connects China with its long-term ally Pakistan. Beijing has invested about $60bn (£48bn) in Pakistan's infrastructure - the so-called China Pakistan Economic corridor (CPEC) - as part of its Belt and Road Initiative and the highway is key to transporting goods to and from the southern Pakistani port of Gwadar. The port gives China a foothold in the Arabian Sea.

In addition, China was unhappy when India initially banned all exports of medical and protective equipment to shore up its stocks soon after the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year.

How dangerous could this get?

""We routinely see both armies crossing the LAC - it's fairly common and such incidents are resolved at the local military level. But this time, the build-up is the largest we have ever seen,"" says former Indian diplomat P Stobdan, an expert in Ladakh and India-China affairs.

""The stand-off is happening at some strategic areas that are important for India. If Pangong lake is taken, Ladakh can't be defended. If the Chinese military is allowed to settle in the strategic valley of Shyok, then the Nubra valley and even Siachen can be reached.""

In what seems to be an intelligence failure, India seems to have been caught off guard again. According to Indian media accounts, the country's soldiers were outnumbered and surrounded when China swiftly diverted men and machines from a military exercise to the border region.

This triggered alarm in Delhi - and India has limited room for manoeuvre. It can either seek to persuade Beijing to withdraw its troops through dialogue or try to remove them by force. Neither is an easy option.

""China is the world's second-largest military power. Technologically it's superior to India. Infrastructure on the other side is very advanced. Financially, China can divert its resources to achieve its military goals, whereas the Indian economy has been struggling in recent years, and the coronavirus crisis has worsened the situation,"" says Ajai Shukla.

What next?

History holds difficult lessons for India. It suffered a humiliating defeat during the 1962 border conflict with China. India says China occupies 38,000km of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary issues.

China already controls the Aksai Chin area further east of Ladakh and this region, claimed by India, is strategically important for Beijing as it connects its Xinjiang province with western Tibet.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption India and China have a long history of border disputes

In 2017 India and China were engaged in a similar stand-off lasting more than two months in Doklam plateau, a tri-junction between India, China and Bhutan.

India objected to China building a road in a region claimed by Bhutan. The Chinese stood firm. Within six months, Indian media reported that Beijing had built a permanent all-weather military complex there.

This time, too, talks are seen as the only way forward - both countries have so much to lose in a military conflict.

""China has no intention to escalate tensions and I think India also doesn't want a conflict. But the situation depends on both sides. The Indian government should not be guided by the nationalistic media comments,"" says Dr Long Xingchun of the CIWA in Chengdu. ""Both countries have the ability to solve the dispute through high-level talks.""

Chinese media have given hardly any coverage to the border issue, which is being interpreted as a possible signal that a route to talks will be sought.

Pratyush Rao, associate director for South Asia at Control Risks consultancy, says both sides have ""a clear interest in prioritising their economic recovery"" and avoiding military escalation.

""It is important to recognise that both sides have a creditable record of maintaining relative peace and stability along their disputed border.""","It has completely changed the status quo,"" says Ajai Shukla, an Indian military expert who served as a colonel in the army.
Reports in the Indian media said soldiers from the two sides clashed on at least two occasions in Ladakh.
India and China share a border more than 3,440km (2,100 miles) long and have overlapping territorial claims.
""According to the Chinese military, India is the one which has forced its way into the Galwan valley.
If the Chinese military is allowed to settle in the strategic valley of Shyok, then the Nubra valley and even Siachen can be reached.""","['chinaindia', 'china', 'rising', 'military', 'indian', 'ladakh', 'tensions', 'road', 'chinese', 'sides', 'neighbours', 'india', 'border', 'media']"

My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here Alyssa Hulme from Heber City in Utah, US, takes us through a week in her life during the coronavirus pandemic.

Alyssa, 31, is a freelance writer and educational consultant. She and her husband Randy have four children: Ellie, eight, Max, seven, Amethyst, four and Josie, one. She has been homeschooling her children for a year, months before the pandemic started.

She says her week started out mundane but ended up awesome! She had no idea on Monday where she would be by Sunday.

Over to Alyssa....

I started the day nursing my one-year-old, passed her off to her dad for breakfast and settled down for a solid 45 minutes of private time before spending the rest of the day homeschooling three kids and caring for a baby. After prayer, meditation, and setting my To-Dos for the day, I purchased a course, the 30-day Money Cure with Carol Tuttle for $297 (£242). The course is on gaining financial affluence by clearing out limiting belief systems that don't serve me and replacing them with healthy practices. I have been looking forward to this course for months and have set aside money for this specific purpose.

After that I moved on to begin my day with my family and set everyone to their beginning tasks of piano, chores, and math. We've been homeschooling for a year now, so it's been a pretty typical day. But at lunchtime instead of transitioning to a play date, my husband took our eldest out for one-on-one time to help supplement the loss of activities and outings that has come with Covid-19 lockdowns.

We've been isolating since the end of February and the loss of friends is wearing on us all. During our midday quiet time I taught two online vocal training lessons virtually to students who live in town. Typically they'd come to my home, but we are all still isolating. After that we settled into our evening routine: I made dinner, we ate together and then held our weekly ""family night"" - an evening of talent shows, games, treats and fun.

Total spend: $297 (£242)

I continued with the money course. I am starting up a homeschool consulting business and really want to get on the correct and mentally healthy track for the sake of my business. The course has helped me identify several limiting beliefs I can clear up to allow space for more growth. Then, as every weekday for months, we did homeschool, lunch and quiet time in the afternoon.

During quiet time I had a virtual occupational therapy appointment for my one-year-old in order to evaluate her for possible gross motor delays. This is free through our state. Next I had a virtual appointment with my therapist. This costs $110 after insurance and is withdrawn from my Health Saving Account, an account we pay into monthly through my husband's pay check and is tax free. Therapy always really takes it out of me and today it was compounded by some new business issues I'm working through, so my husband picked up dinner from a fastfood Chinese restaurant for $40. It ended up being a lot of food and will last a good two and a half meals for the six of us.

I took the evening to work more on my business and work on my personal goals. Normally I'd go out with friends or go to the gym, but everything is closed, so I get to save more money and get to know my bed a little better.

Total spend: $150 (£122)

Our big outing today was a trip up the canyon near our home. We spent two hours hiking in the woods, building fairy houses and crossing streams.

Later in the evening I started making plans for next year's homeschool and bought some notebooks and stationery through Target.com. I really dislike online shopping, especially for something as personal as a notebook. As a writer, the size, weight and binding of a notebook really matters to me, so buying from an online shop is very disorienting.

I also bought a summer dress through Target.com, something I can easily nurse in and hope to be able to wear out and about someday here soon when the quarantine is lifted. Our county just moved to a low-risk status, so hopefully my husband and I can start up our weekly date nights soon.

Total spend: $110.52 (£90)

Late last night my husband discovered that he will not be returning to work in his office until the end of 2020. We discussed buying a motorhome, living in it for the next six months, renting out our home, and working and doing homeschool on the go. This has been a dream of ours for 10 years, but it never worked out with our careers. Now is the time.

Today we decided to rent an RV (recreational vehicle) - $1,160 for four nights - and start testing out different configurations and living quarters. We decided to head for Yellowstone National Park. Two of the four entrances are now open! I found an RV site and started packing up.

I normally would have gone grocery shopping last night but our travel plans halted that. As a result we were out of food today, so I grabbed lunch from a local shop for $33.50 and dinner from a restaurant for $45. This is not a normal thing for us to just pick up and drop a ton of money on travel, but we have now been in isolation since the end of February and we are all so ready to have a new experience.

This money is coming from the allotment my husband and I had set aside to celebrate our 10 year anniversary tomorrow, but all our kid-free-for-the-first-time-in-five-years international travel plans were squashed by the virus. This will be an interesting substitute.

We parked the RV along our path to Yellowstone at a Walmart. Anyone can park there overnight for free, so it's a great backup to have in mind when travelling.

Total spend: $1,238.50 (£1,005)

Happy 10 year anniversary to my husband and me! We celebrate the day by first getting groceries from Walmart and starting the trek to Yellowstone. I bought groceries for the week for $233. Not too bad for a family of six with limited fridge and cupboard space. We stopped to fill up the RV with gas for $213. After several hours of driving, we arrived at the spot I had reserved online yesterday for two nights, a total of $180, including water and electricity plug-ins. It's a little high for an RV site, but it's the closest I could find to the park entrance online and we decided to value time in the park over the cost of the campsite. (All the sites inside the park are closed due to Covid-19.)

More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series:

We woke early and headed to the park today, but it was closed due to a snowstorm. The road ended up getting 12 inches of snow in some places! Instead of exploring the park we explored the National Forest just outside.

We got up early again and were able to enter the park! We used our National Parks Pass to get in, so no cost today. We did everything that was open in the park, the big attractions for us being the Upper and Lower falls outlooks, the Grand Prismatic Spring, and Old Faithful.

We saw so much wildlife on this trip, far more than my husband or I even saw here as children. We drove by and hiked next to elk, bison, deer, egrets, and even several bears including a baby and mama bear. We attribute this expanse of wildlife to conservation efforts in the park as well as the closure of the park over the last several months.

The snow also allowed us to see all the animal tracks throughout the park which our kids loved! Old Faithful had the largest crowd, but still very small even for this time of year. We watched with a small, social distancing crowd for the big event, and then headed out. We were tempted to get take-out from the lodge near Old Faithful, but decided to continue eating the food we'd already purchased knowing the lodge food prices are really marked up.

We packed up and exited the park through the South Entrance and drove through Grand Tetons National Park and got gas in Jackson Hole for $176. Wyoming has lots of open land for free parking, but with a new vehicle and dark terrain, we decided to stay overnight in a National Forest campsite a half hour away for $15 for the night. We pulled in about 23:00, paid via cash in a drop box, and enjoyed sleeping next to a river and under a blanket of stars.

Total spend: $191 (£156)

Total spent this week: $2,613.02 (£2,125)

How does Alyssa feel about her week?

Thanks for coming with me on my 10 year wedding anniversary trip! This is not the trip we'd planned, but it's been wonderful for our family. We've seen two more National Parks, taken a break from quarantine in a way that feels safe for us, and enjoyed our beautiful nation.

This is an unusually high week for us because we went on our trip. But considering $2,000 of that was spent on our trip and only $613.02 spent on our normal life, I feel good about that. We had $2,000+ saved for months now to go to Barbados later this summer, but we have given up all international travel until the virus settles down. All in, I feel like this was a successful trip. We would not be moving forward with purchasing an RV had we not had the real life experience of travelling in one for an extended period of time.

The remaining $613.02 also reflects an unusual cost in the money course I am taking. I haven't purchased class tuition in probably five years, but being home all the time has me under-stimulated and needing a project.

I think like many families these days, our spending in many areas has decreased (no extracurriculars, less shopping and self-care purchases, almost no gas purchases), but in other ways expanded. I don't bring my kids into any grocery stores anymore, so when my husband is too busy at work to be with them and we run out of food, I get take-out meals. When our mental health is being run down by monotony, we rent RVs, buy our kids bikes, and online shop for anything to help the kids make it through the day. This is survival for us.

I feel very privileged to be financially secure and have a very stable income. While the world is in chaos we will continue to use money as a tool to support our mental wellbeing and try to take advantage of the new opportunities opening up to us.

114,"Uzma Khan: An actress assaulted, a jealous wife and a viral video in Pakistan",https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-52842720,"['M Ilyas Khan', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Uzmakhan/FB Image caption Uzma Khan went to the police and wants the people who attacked her to be arrested

Police in Pakistan are investigating three women over the assault of a well-known actress in her home, after footage posted on social media went viral and the actress lodged a case.

The video shows three women and about a dozen armed guards entering Uzma Khan's house in Lahore. They smash up property and interrogate and assault the actress and her sister.

Despite her celebrity and such a dramatic sequence of events, the incident has barely made it into the Pakistani media.

This is probably because two of the women alleged to be involved in the attack have been named as the daughters of one of Pakistan's most powerful property magnates, Malik Riaz - and the media is wary of running stories about his family.

The influential property tycoon has distanced himself from what happened, saying he had no involvement in what he called ""disgraceful incidents"".

His daughters have not made any public comment but the other woman who has been named in the police report, Amena Usman Malik, has.

She has defended her actions in another video, and accused the actress Uzma Khan of having an affair with her husband.

Although there is little in the mainstream media, social media has been consumed by the drama, which provides some insight into the personal enmities and politics of the country's elite - as well as the media's reluctance to tackle certain issues.

What do the videos show?

The incident happened on Saturday night, just before the Eid festival at the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. After a number of videos were shared on social media, police announced they were launching an investigation on Wednesday.

They have registered a formal complaint against the three women and their guards for allegedly breaking and entering the actress's residence, beating up her and her sister and damaging their property.

In one video a woman can be heard questioning Ms Khan about her relations with the questioner's husband, Usman Malik. The woman asking the questions is allegedly Amena Usman Malik, said to be a niece of Malik Riaz's son-in-law.

It is alleged in the police complaint that she was accompanied by two of the tycoon's daughters, Amber and Pashmina Malik.

Another video shows the women abusing and harassing Ms Khan and her sister Huma. Broken glass and possessions are shown strewn around the property, as well as blood stains on the floor.

One of the woman can be heard threatening Ms Khan and her sister with kidnapping by the military's feared ISI intelligence service. The ISI is widely accused of illegally disappearing people, a charge the military denies.

In a third video, a visibly distressed Uzma Khan said she and her sister had just ended their aitekaf (a period of 3-10 days of worship in isolation during the last days of Ramadan) on the eve of Eid when Usman Malik, the husband of Amena, called to offer Eid greetings.

Soon afterwards, the women and their guards crashed into the house.

Some on social media questioned why the women had directed their anger at Uzma Khan, and not the man she was accused of having an affair with.

""The most problematic way women deal with their husband's infidelity is to cast all blame on the other woman while absolving their husband of all moral obligations. This aggression & indignation should have been directed at the woman's husband!"" tweeted one observer.

In a video statement posted after footage of events inside the house went viral, Amena Usman Malik was open about having entered the property. But she did not address the allegations of assault and theft being investigated by police, or confirm the names of others who were with her.

""As far as barging into someone's home is concerned, this was not their house. This was my husband's other house which I followed him to - so basically this was my husband's home and I have every right to be there.

""I repeatedly warned this girl to save my 13-year-long marriage. This was not the first time I approached her.""

She added that ""my husband, Usman Malik has nothing to do with Malik Riaz Hussain, he's not a part of his immediate family. This is being done to malign Malik Riaz.""

She said she had also left her husband.

He has made no public comment, and the BBC has been unable to reach him.

What does the actress say?

Uzma Khan has accused the women and their private guards of trespassing, causing injuries, damaging property and taking away valuables worth five million rupees (about $31,000) from the house.

At a news conference on Thursday at which Ms Khan was present, her lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq said Usman Malik had been friends with Uzma Khan for two years.

But, the lawyer said, Ms Khan ended her relationship with him in December. Nonetheless, he had continued to visit the house off and on, reporters were told.

""Uzma has Usman's phone calls and messages saved in her phone and we will table them in the court,"" Mr Ashfaq said.

He also rejected Amena Malik's claim in her video that the house she broke into was her husband's property.

Ms Khan and her sister needed protection, he said, because their lives were at risk, and he called for the immediate arrest of those named in the police complaint.

The two other women named in the complaint have not made any public comment, and neither have any of the guards.

Why has the media been quiet?

In most countries, this kind of story would be splashed all over the headlines. But not in Pakistan.

The property magnate - and father of two of the women named - Malik Riaz swiftly threatened to file a defamation suit ""against anyone who tries to implicate me wrongfully for such disgraceful incidents"".

Skip Twitter post by @MalikRiaz_ I categorically rebut this malicious propaganda associating me with a viral video.Usman is not my nephew.I'm appalled at such below the belt attempt to malign me for something I'm not involved in any capacity. (1/2) — Malik Riaz Hussain (@MalikRiaz_) May 27, 2020 Report

Barring one or two exceptions, the Pakistani media has remained quiet on the issue.

115,Coronavirus in South Africa: Eight lessons for the rest of the continent,https://bbc.com/news/world-africa-52835160,"['Andrew Harding', 'Africa Correspondent', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Getty Images

South Africa leads this continent in many ways. Right now, it is poised to lead Africa into the next, most dangerous phase of the pandemic, as the country braces itself for a dramatic rise in infections that will almost certainly overwhelm its relatively well-resourced healthcare system.

Here are eight things it can teach the rest of Africa:

1) Keep the tea rooms clean

No, it is not a joke. Governments, and medical teams, still need to focus a lot more on hygiene.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The most dangerous place in a clinic is considered the tea room

Instead of wasting time and money - as many experts now see it - on acquiring expensive but relatively ineffective ventilators, the evidence from South African hospitals already grappling with the virus points to the need for vastly improved hygiene protocols.

Several major hospitals have already been forced to shut after becoming hot spots for the virus.

Doctors are warning that medical staff continue to congregate in tea rooms, removing their masks, passing mobile phones to each other, and undermining all the work they do on the wards.

""The most dangerous place in a clinic is undoubtedly the tea room. We're trying to get that message out,"" said Doctor Tom Boyles, an infectious disease specialist in Johannesburg.

2) Fast tests - or no tests

After a promising start, South Africa is now struggling, woefully, with its testing.

It has built up a huge backlog - ""tens of thousands"" according to several sources - at its laboratories, which is now undermining the validity of the entire testing process.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption It is taking 14 days to get the results of Covid-19 tests

""How do we prioritise limited resources?"" asked Prof Shabir Madhi, a prominent vaccine expert, who said South Africa's likely testing limit - because of financial and logistical constraints - would stay at about 20,000 per day.

An impressive number, perhaps, but of no real use, doctors insist, unless the results of those tests can reliably be produced within, ideally, 24 hours.

Much longer than that and an infected person will either have spread the virus to too many others to trace properly, or they will already be in hospital, or they will have passed the point of serious risk for infecting others.

""Currently the turnaround time for Covid tests is around 14 days in most places, so that basically means it's a complete waste of time,"" said Dr Boyles.

The same concerns apply to South Africa's much-hailed community screening and testing programme which, experts say, has outlived its usefulness, since the virus has now spread far beyond the capacity of the country's large team of community health workers to track with any effectiveness.

""The timeline renders it meaningless and compromises the care that should be occurring in hospitals,"" according to Prof Madhi, who said it was vital that the testing system be aimed, as efficiently as possible, at hospitals, medical staff and those at most risk.

But there are signs of a political battle delaying these changes, with officials reportedly resisting calls for older tests to be simply thrown away.

3) It is not old age, it is obesity

Much has been made of the fact that Africa has an unusually young population, and, indeed, that may yet help to mitigate the impact of the virus here.

But the evidence from several South African hospitals already suggests that alarmingly high levels of obesity - along with hypertension and diabetes - in younger Covid-19 patients are linked to many fatalities.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More than half of all South Africans are now considered medically overweight

It is believed that as many South Africans suffer from hypertension and diabetes as from HIV - some seven million people. That is one in eight of the population. Some of them are undiagnosed.

Two-thirds of coronavirus deaths in South Africa so far are among people aged under 65, according to Prof Madhi.

""Obesity is a big issue, along with hypertension and diabetes,"" he said.

Although demographic differences make it hard to make direct comparisons between countries, over half of younger South Africans who are dying from Covid-19 have some other illness - roughly twice the rate seen in Europe.

4) Exposure isn't always exposure

A busy antenatal clinic in Johannesburg recently closed down following reports that one member of staff had been exposed to a coronavirus patient. Twelve nurses were sent home and told to self-isolate.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts say the fear factor about coronavirus needs to be addressed

The move has been quietly condemned by many doctors who see it as evidence of a wider climate of unnecessary fear and over-caution among medical staff which is in danger of crippling the country's health system and undermining its fight against the virus.

""There needs to be clear guidance on what sort exposure is significant. We have not adequately demystified this virus,"" said Prof Madhi, who stressed that a person needed to spend 15 minutes or more in close proximity to a confirmed case to be considered at serious risk of infection.

Unions have been understandably robust in seeking to protect their members and to raise concerns where personal protection equipment (PPE) has been lacking.

Shabir Madhi The investment in ventilators was a huge waste""

But several medical workers told me that tougher discipline was needed to enforce hygiene protocols among staff - along with better education and training about managing risk.

""Fear is the predominant factor. Morale is definitely low,"" said one hospital doctor, on condition of anonymity.

""But you also find people who are looking to get quarantined, who are very happy to take a two-week paid holiday"" in self-isolation.

5) The devil is in the detail

This week South Africa announced that religious groups could resume worship in gatherings of no more than 50 people.

The move was clearly a political concession by a government under pressure to ease lockdown restrictions and that understands that to retain public trust over the longer-term it must show signs of give and take.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption During the lockdown churches have been empty and services have gone online

But the decision carries significant risks. Religious gatherings - often attracting older people - are known globally to be hot spots for spreading the virus. By choosing to ignore that fact, the government may be undercutting its own messaging.

""It undermines any pretence that the regulations are rules are science-based,"" said political scientist and commentator Richard Calland.

One option for the government might have been to bar anyone over 65 from attending a religious service. Instead it has told religious leaders to implement strict social-distancing and hygiene policies in their churches and mosques.

Will they comply?

All non-authoritarian governments eventually have to rely on the public's willingness to obey, not just the broad spirit of any regulations, but - as the tea room troubles indicate - the granular detail of clean prayer mats, no-contact services and no more than one person for every 2.5 sq m (about 26 sq ft) of church hall.

6) Winning the peace

South Africa's official opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has been struggling to make itself heard during the lockdown.

A crisis of this magnitude inevitably pushes opposition parties to the sidelines and, one could argue, they would do well to stay there.

Coronavirus in Africa:

When the DA has sought to attract attention to itself, it has shown signs of flip-flopping on policy.

""They should be playing a much longer game, looking to win the peace, not the war,"" said Mr Calland, citing the example of Clement Atlee, who swept to power in the UK, defeating Winston Churchill in the immediate aftermath of World War Two.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Ramaphosa's political rivals will seek to blame him for the inevitable rise in infections

The much smaller, populist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has already indicated how it plans to win political capital from the crisis, by opposing any easing of the lockdown (its racialised antipathy to foreign investment and to big business freeing it from serious concern about the economic impact).

It will presumably seek to blame President Cyril Ramaphosa for the inevitable rise in infections and deaths.

Mr Ramaphosa's own enemies within the governing African National Congress (ANC) - currently silenced - may well make common cause with the EFF on that issue.

The blame game will be a brutal one across the continent. Will the power of incumbency - such an important factor in African politics and beyond - prove to be a strength or a weakness with Covid-19?

7) Bring the public with you

When South Africa banned the sale of alcohol during the lockdown, many people accepted it as a harsh, but perhaps necessary step to limit domestic abuse, prevent violence, and thus keep hospital beds free for coronavirus patients.

Getty Images The ban is playing into the hands of powerful criminal syndicates controlling contraband cigarettes, and is costing the government a fortune in lost tax revenues""

But over time, frustration - with the ban, and with the brutal and haphazard enforcement of it - has grown and the clampdown is now set to be partly lifted. So far so good.

But in tandem with the alcohol ban, South Africa put a stop to all cigarettes sales too. And that will remain in force indefinitely.

The government insists its decision is based on scientific evidence, but few people seem to believe that is what is really guiding ministers. Instead many suspect that officials are using the lockdown as cover to introduce their own pet projects.

The ban is playing into the hands of powerful criminal syndicates controlling contraband cigarettes, and is costing the government a fortune in lost tax revenues.

But perhaps more importantly, it is undermining the credibility of the lockdown regulations themselves - making compliance, as the country moves to ease some restrictions on movement, less likely.

8) Keeping it simple

For weeks, it seemed, everyone was talking about finding and building ventilators. But the experience of frontline doctors in Cape Town has already shown that simpler, cheaper and less-intrusive devices can play a far more important role.

Countries need to plan according to their limited resources.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption With Covid-19 breathing can become difficult and the lungs get inflamed

""The investment in ventilators was a huge waste,"" said Prof Madhi, who, like colleagues in Cape Town, stressed the importance of high-flow nasal oxygen machines that work more efficiently than more traditional oxygen masks.

He said he had been ""raising the alarm"" about the need to improve South Africa's supply of oxygen ""for about six weeks"".

Hospitals in Cape Town are also following the international example of ""proning"" - lying patients face down in order to improve oxygen supply to their lungs.

The principal of looking for simpler solutions applies to staffing too, with many doctors urging the health authorities to focus on bringing final-year medical students, and perhaps retired staff, into an overstretched system, rather than importing expensive foreign doctors from places like Cuba.","2) Fast tests - or no testsAfter a promising start, South Africa is now struggling, woefully, with its testing.

116,Coronavirus: Biden and Trump face off over China,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52835651,"['Reality Check Team', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US election is likely to be overshadowed by the coronavirus

As the US grapples with the coronavirus outbreak, President Donald Trump and and his likely election rival, Joe Biden, have been locking horns over the handling of the crisis.

They've traded accusations about access to China for US health experts, and restrictions on flights from China following the outbreak.

We've been looking at some of these claims and counter-claims.

Claim 1

President Trump failed to get US health officials into China to inspect the outbreak

Mr Biden has said there was ""no effort"" by the president to get US officials into China to inspect the initial outbreak, and also claimed that ""Trump never got a CDC team on the ground in China.""

But the Trump administration says it did try.

Health Secretary Alex Azar told journalists in late January that the US had offered on 6 January to send a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - an offer that was repeated later that month and in February.

The CDC is the top government body responsible for protecting public health.

Two US experts did get into China as part of a multinational delegation from the World Health Organization, which went in mid-February.

These were Weigong Zhou from the US CDC, and Clifford Lane from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

It's also worth adding that the CDC itself has had an office in China for decades (more on this further down).

Claim 2

Trump allowed 40,000 people to travel to US from China after the travel ban

President Trump and Mr Biden have also clashed over how airtight the restrictions introduced on travel from China are.

Mr Trump issued an order on 31 January which stopped foreign nationals who had been in China in the previous two weeks from entering the US. This came into effect on 2 February.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The travel restrictions didn't apply to US citizens and legal residents

An advert by the Biden campaign claims the president let 40,000 travellers into the US from China after he signed the order. President Trump has hit back, saying these were US citizens coming home.

The order does have exemptions for US citizens, legal residents, and non-citizen relatives with close ties.

Flight data analysed by the New York Times shows 40,000 people arrived in the US directly from China in the two months after President Trump's restrictions.

We don't know how many of these were US citizens, but it is unlikely they all were - as President Trump claims - with other exemptions also applying.

Claim 3

President Trump cut the numbers of US disease experts in China before the outbreak

This claim by Mr Biden refers to the presence of a CDC office inside China, which it's maintained for decades.

Joe Biden said: ""We had over 44, if I'm not mistaken, people from the CDC in China, to observe what was going on. The president brought home the vast majority of them and I think left only four in place.""

Mr Biden is right that overall numbers of CDC staff in China have come down significantly, but he's not correct about the numbers.

The CDC website says that as of March this year there were 14 staff in total working in China - three from the US and 11 employed locally.

That's down from 47 CDC staff a year earlier, eight of whom were US employees and 39 of whom were locally recruited.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Centers for Disease Control is the top US public health agency

Mr Biden further alleges that a key US expert role inside China has not been filled.

He said: ""We had an American official stationed inside the Chinese disease control agency serving as our eyes and ears. President Trump left the position vacant as the outbreak hit.""

It's true that the last American - a CDC employee - left her role in China's disease control agency in 2019 before the coronavirus emerged, and was not replaced.

When President Trump was asked about this on 22 March, he said that media reports about the CDC were ""100 percent wrong"" and then referred the question to Robert Redfield, the CDC director, who was with him.

Mr Redfield said the CDC ""China office is actually being augmented, as we speak,"" but didn't explain why this particular role had ceased.

Claim 4

Biden called Trump xenophobic for China travel ban

President Trump claims Mr Biden ""went crazy"" and called him ""xenophobic"" for banning people entering the US from China.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US introduced restrictions on flights from China in early February

When the order was announced, Mr Biden did say it wasn't the time for ""Donald Trump's record of hysterical xenophobia"", and the next day tweeted a similar message.

The Biden campaign says this wasn't a reference to the travel restrictions, but to the president's overall record in office.

Mr Biden has never specifically said he opposed travel restrictions per se, but he did say in March that ""travel restrictions based on favouritism and politics, rather than risk, will be counter-productive"".

He publicly supported the travel ban in early April, with his campaign saying: ""Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.""

President Trump has also said Mr Biden wrote him a letter of apology regarding his comments about the China travel restrictions, but this isn't true, according to the Biden campaign.

117,George Floyd death: Why has a US city gone up in flames?,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52854037,"['Jessica Lussenhop', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Getty Images

Tensions between Minneapolis' black community and the police did not start with the death of George Floyd. They have been years in the making.

On a hot Thursday morning in the Longfellow neighbourhood of Minneapolis, a 28-year-old father named Nuwman stood outside the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct drinking a large coffee as smoke wafted past from the smouldering ruins of nearby buildings.

It was day three of protests over the death of 46-year-old George Floyd, after a white police officer named Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd begged for his life before falling unconscious and dying in the street, in full view of witnesses and a rolling mobile phone camera. Four officers, including Chauvin, were fired from the department for their involvement.

The previous night, tensions ignited, and for the first time the city saw looting, arson and violence. At least one man died in a shooting at a pawn shop.

""This is everyday. Everyday that these police officers have enforced their protocol has led up to this,"" said Nuwman, his voice rising with emotion over the din of protesters and sirens. ""This is not just a singular moment. This is a cataclysm. A combination of all the things that happened before.""

That night, protesters stormed the precinct as police cruisers flew out of the rear parking lot, abandoning it to demonstrators who quickly moved from room to room lighting blazes.

Image copyright Reuters

The following afternoon, a Friday, saw the arrest of Chauvin by Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Chauvin has been charged with murder.

This is not the first instance of a controversial, police-involved killing in the region. In 2016, Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer in a neighbourhood just 15 minutes away from the current epicentre of protest.

In 2017, a Minneapolis officer was charged with the shooting death of Justine Damond after she called to report a possible sexual assault. In 2015, protests erupted over the shooting death of Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old man who was being pursued by Minneapolis officers.

All three deaths sparked protest movements and yielded mixed results in terms of prosecution. Yanez was tried and acquitted. Mohamed Noor, Damond's shooter, was sentenced to 12.5 years. No charges were brought in Clark's case.

For some, Floyd's death was the continuation of those stories.

""WE SHOULD HAVE BURNT THE CITY DOWN FOR PHILANDO CASTILE,"" one person posted on social media.

But in some ways, the pictures beamed around the world this week tell a story that's unique.

Demonstrations are occurring in the midst of a historic, global pandemic. The sheer amount of property damage and arson has been staggering. The swiftness with which officers were fired, and the speed in which Chauvin was arrested and charged surprised many.

But Minneapolis - while a prosperous city that celebrates liberal policies and politicians - has struggled for years with socioeconomic inequality and segregation. It's a phenomenon that's been dubbed the ""Minnesota paradox"".

The Twin Cities, as Minneapolis and St Paul are known, are still overwhelmingly white - about one-quarter of the population is non-white - and its neighbourhoods are still highly segregated. Most people of colour live on the cities' north sides.

They were shaped by racist red-lining policies dating to the early 20th Century, when black families were not allowed to buy homes in certain neighbourhoods. In the 1960s, the state built a major highway that cut through and destroyed a thriving black community known as Rondo in St Paul.

According to a 2018 study, the rate of black homeownership in the Twin Cities is among the lowest in the nation.

Even before the pandemic caused massive layoffs, 10% of black residents were unemployed compared to 4% of whites. That disparity ranks as one of the nation's worst.

In 2016, the average white household in the Twin Cities made about $76,000 a year, while the average black household earned just $32,000. Thirty-two percent of black Twin Citians fell below the poverty line, while only 6.5% of whites did.

Racial disparities persist in the way the community is policed.

After Philando Castile was killed, data released about police traffic stops in the area showed that 44% of stops were black drivers, though the population was only 7% black.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protests spread to other cities including New York City

According to the Minneapolis police department's own data, in 2018 55% of drivers stopped for ""equipment violations"" were black.

As Covid-19 ravages the area, these disparities are sure to worsen, as thousands lose their jobs, and their homes to evictions and foreclosures.

On Friday afternoon, residents of both St Paul and Minneapolis headed into the streets carrying brooms and pails, and slowly began to literally pick up the pieces of the town.

Following the announcement that former officer Chauvin had been jailed and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, protesters at Minneapolis City Hall let up a cheer.

But it was quickly replaced by a new demand: ""One down, three to go.""

118,Akinwumi Adesina: Why the US is targeting a flamboyant Nigerian banker,https://bbc.com/news/world-africa-52831185,[],"Image copyright Getty Images

The US and the African Development Bank have fallen out over allegations of corruption against the bank's Nigerian head, writes former BBC Africa Business editor Larry Madowo.

Akinwumi Adesina is a sharp dresser known for his expensive tailored suits, immaculate white shirts and an endless supply of colourful bow ties.

But the clean public persona of the 60-year-old president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) is now being questioned after a string of corruption and abuse of office allegations from his own staff spilled into the open. Mr Adesina has denied all the allegations.

The board of governors of the 55-year-old institution met on Tuesday to discuss whether to bring in an outside investigator into the allegations concerning the Nigerian's conduct just days after the US rejected an initial inquiry that cleared him.

The prospects of an independent probe comes only three months before he was expected to be re-elected unopposed at its annual general meeting in August.

US at odds with Africa

The 20-point allegations of ""impunity and bad governance"" from unnamed employees have exposed a rift between Mr Adesina and ordinary staff.

The ""Group of Concerned Staff Members of the AfDB"" claimed that Mr Adesina has used the bank's resources for self-promotion and personal gain while also paying out huge but undeserved severance packages to staff who resigned mysteriously, and favouring his fellow Nigerians.

US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin personally signed a letter to the board rejecting an internal investigation that cleared Mr Adesina.

""Mnuchin's move is significant because it has now cast a limelight on governance issues and on [the] importance of an independent investigation to uphold the integrity of the AfDB,"" said Barbara Barungi, the bank's former lead economist on Nigeria. ""There are very few people that were willing to stick their necks out.""

Besides the core 54 African countries, the US is one of the 27 non-regional members of the AfDB and its second largest shareholder.

AfDB's 10 biggest shareholders:

Nigeria: 9.1%; US: 6.5%; Egypt: 5.5%; Japan: 5.4%;

9.1%; 6.5%; 5.5%; 5.4%; South Africa: 4.9% Algeria: 4.1%; Germany: 4%;

4.9% 4.1%; 4%; Canada: 3.8%; Ivory Coast: 3.7%; France: 3.6%

""I think AfDB is Africa's most valuable institution,"" said one insider who spoke on condition of anonymity.

""But what you have now is the biggest paymaster, the US, in a stand-off against the Africans. If you read Mnuchin's letter carefully, it has put the bank on notice.""

The BBC has obtained the original whistleblowers' email from January 2020, sent to two executive directors of the bank, Yano Takuji (Japanese) and Steven Dowd (American), and the British director for its Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department Alan Bacarese.

Getty We fear that the wholesale dismissal of all allegations without appropriate investigation will tarnish the reputation of this institution [AfDB]""

In an April update circulated to a wider pool of senior managers, the whistleblowers said the Ethics Committee headed by Mr Takuji failed to examine their concerns.

The committee later carried out an investigation and declared that Mr Adesina was ""totally exonerated of all allegations made against him"" and recommended that the board of governors adopt its conclusions.

In early May, the board's chair - Ivorian Planning Minister Nialé Kaba - wrote to shareholders that the African finance ministers who supervise the bank's management intended to clear Mr Adesina.

""We fear that the wholesale dismissal of all allegations without appropriate investigation will tarnish the reputation of this institution as one that does not uphold high standards of ethics and governance,"" Mr Mnuchin wrote back.

""Therefore, the United States cannot support dismissing the allegations at this stage,"" he added.

Mr Kaba said in a statement that a decision had not been made about Mr Adesina and he remained in office.

""The bureau, which I chair, wishes to reassure the public that it is seized with the matter and it is treating it with the utmost seriousness that it deserves,"" he said.

'Trumped up allegations'

The whistleblowers have accused Mr Adesina of major conflicts of interest in his dealings with current and former employees, unethical conduct and preferential treatment.

Eight things about Akinwumi Adesina:

First Nigerian to lead AfDB

Elected for five-year term in September 2015

Was Nigeria's agriculture minister from 2011 until his move

Named Forbes Africa Person of the Year in 2013 for his ""bold reforms"" in farming sector

Was told by an academic in Nigeria he would never get into Purdue University as his maths was poor

Proved him wrong by getting into the prestigious US institution

Cancelled his admission to UK's respected Cambridge University

Got his PhD in agricultural economics in 1988

Sources: AfDB; Forbes magazine

Mr Adesina, who holds a PhD in agricultural economics from Purdue University in the US, did not respond to BBC requests for comment but released a statement.

""In spite of unprecedented attempts by some to tarnish my reputation and prejudice the bank's governance procedures, I maintain my innocence with regard to trumped up allegations that unjustly seek to impugn my honour and integrity,"" he wrote.

""I am confident that fair, transparent and just processes that respect the rules, procedures and governance systems of the Bank, and rule of law, will ultimately prove that I have not violated the Code of Ethics of this extraordinary institution.""

The AfDB board meeting is said to have agreed to an independent investigation into the allegations concerning Mr Adesina's conduct after Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland supported the US position, Bloomberg news agency first reported.

""Should it surprise the world that we're getting a second investigation backed by no African country? What does that say about the other countries that have lined up behind the US?"" wonders Debisi Araba, a friend of Mr Adesina's.

""He's due to run unopposed but you want to muddy the waters with this stain of corruption. I believe he will be vindicated.""

Reuters Who the AfDB says it helped in May: Cape Verde: $33m loan approved to tackle Covid-19

Zimbabwe: $13.7m grant approved to improve health sector

Cameroon and Chad: $45m allocated for bridge to link the two states

Eswatini:$1.67m given for study on building dams Source: AfDB

Mr Araba worked for Mr Adesina in the Nigerian government and was also an intern at the bank while doing his PhD in 2009.

He says the bank has always had a culture of salacious rumour and gossip but faults the US for formalizing the ""crass, bargain basement reasoning"" into a complaint.

This was denied by a US Treasury spokesperson, who told the BBC: ""The United States continues to value the AfDB and its efforts to promote development, reduce poverty, and address the current health and economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the African continent.""

Chinese 'shopping spree in Africa'

Some policy analysts at think-tanks in Washington, DC, worry about the timing of the American pushback and its longer-term consequences in Africa.

""A prolonged battle will be a distraction for the AfDB when its resources are more desperately needed than ever for its borrowers,"" Nancy Birdsall, a Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development told the BBC.

She said it was not good for the AfDB if Mr Mnuchin was unhappy and suggested that ""the US Treasury should look for some form of quiet compromise in which no-one loses face"".

Ms Birdsall also reiterated a recommendation she made in a 2018 paper for the leadership of the AfDB to open up its shareholding, including to China and oil-rich economies.

But Daniel F Runde, senior vice-president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, disagreed.

He said the Abidjan-based bank that lends exclusively to African governments represented one of the few non-China-led and western-funded approaches to development on the continent.

""If Adesina is cleared, the US may need to mend fences with the management because China will probably go on a shopping spree in Africa after Covid-19, and we will need every non-Chinese tool to respond,"" he said.

Mr Runde saw Mr Mnuchin's letter as ""disruption"" and called it a good tactic but a poor strategy.

""Now that the Trump administration has caused disruption and perhaps made a point, they have to decide when this plays out,"" he said.

Getty Independent accountability measures strengthen institutions and reinforce their legitimacy""

Last October, the 81 shareholders of the bank pledged extra funds to more than double its capital to $208bn (£170bn).

Missouri Congressman Emmanuel Cleaver, who sponsored a bill backing the capital increase in the US House of Representatives, came out in support of the new inquiry.

""Independent accountability measures strengthen institutions and reinforce their legitimacy - both domestically and internationally. I am pleased the African Development Bank's Board agreed to take this important step,"" the Democrat told the BBC in a statement.

Mr Adesina is an eloquent advocate for Africa and the bank and a good fundraiser, but his detractors say he promises more than he delivers.

""His administration hasn't always been fantastic and perhaps he has run roughshod over some people. Maybe the practices haven't always been what they should be, and the feeling is that the board just whitewashed the investigation,"" the insider said.

Accused of favouring Nigerians

The whistleblowers also accused Mr Adesina of preferential treatment for Nigeria and Nigerians.

""I don't think we should trivialise the issues and reduce them to anti-Nigerian sentiment,"" said Ms Barungi, the Ugandan-born, Lagos-based former bank employee.

""It's really more about governance concerns that require attention and the investigation to help clear the air,"" she added.

Mr Araba, a Nigerian, said talk of the ""Nigerianisation of the bank"" was false as the country was under-represented in employee numbers despite being the largest shareholder.

As the crisis at the bank escalates, employees, consultants and government officials in African capitals, as well as American foreign policy nerds, wonder how this impasse will end.

But at the Treasury building right next to the White House, Mr Mnuchin and his advisors are doubling down.

""Undertaking an independent evaluation of facts is not at odds with a presumption of innocence, and by promoting transparency and good governance, it can only strengthen the AfDB's capacity to deliver results to people across Africa,"" the spokesman told the BBC.

120,Crossing Divides: The bomb maker turned peacemaker,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-51907603,"['Rebecca Henschke', 'Endang Nurdin', 'Bbc World Service']","Image caption Ali Fauzi is now helping others turn their backs on extremism and intolerance

""I am an expert bomb maker. I can make bombs in just five minutes.""

Ali Fauzi was a key member of Jemaah Islamiyah, a militant group with links to al-Qaeda, which was responsible for Indonesia's worst attack - the 2002 Bali bombing that killed more than 200 people.

""My brothers carried out the Bali bombing. It was huge bomb in the heart of the island's tourist district.""

The group went on to carry out a string of bombings in Indonesia. They were deadly attacks on major hotels and Western embassies. The seemingly sleepy village of Tenggulun in Lamongan, East Java was the group's base camp.

Now Ali Fauzi's mission is very different. He works to help former jihadis leave a life of violence and to stop new recruits from joining the next wave of militant groups in South East Asia.

""The reality is that it is much easier to recruit people to terrorist groups,"" he says.

""They only have to pull a trigger and lots of people will join them but the process of deradicalisation takes time. It has to be done step by step.""

And his new mission has come at a high personal cost.

""The threats against me are intense, it's not just verbal attacks but death threats. But, honestly, I am not scared because I know what I am doing is right. I am ready and prepared to die doing this.""

It was videos of foreign wars - in Afghanistan, Bosnia and the Palestinian Territories, watched on mobile phones from their quiet Javanese village - that motivated Ali Fauzi and his brothers to join militant groups.

""We saw videos of the brutal attacks on civilians. I wanted to carry out jihad to protect the Muslim people from the bullies. With young, hot blood I wanted to fight back.""

While his brothers went to fight alongside the mujahideen, in Afghanistan, Ali Fauzi stayed closer to home, joining Islamic militants fighting for a Muslim homeland in the southern Philippines.

""I really wanted to die there. I imagined my own death all the time,"" he says.

""I believed that if I was killed in battle I would go straight to heaven and be met by angels there. That's what our mentors told us every day.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The 2002 bombings killed 202 people

When his brothers returned from Afghanistan, they put into practice what they had learnt abroad.

In October 2002, they were among a group that detonated two bombs targeting nightclubs in the Kuta area of Bali, the island popular with international tourists.

""I saw it on TV and I was shocked, there were so many dead bodies,"" says Ali Fauzi. ""It led the authorities right to us.""

Two of his brothers, Ali Ghufron and Amrozi, were executed while his third, Ali Imron, is behind bars for life.

Ali Fauzi, who insists he was not involved in the Bali bombing, spent three years in jail for other terror-related offences. That's when his life took on a dramatically new direction.

""Police treated me very humanely. If they had tortured me then maybe seven generations after me would be fighting the Indonesian government,"" he says.

""I hated the police, we thought of them as Satan. That's what we were taught. But the reality was completely different. That's when my whole perspective completely changed.""

He also met victims of bombings his group had carried out.

""I cried. My heart melted, seeing the horrific effect our bombs had. That's what made me really want to change from an agent of war to become a warrior for peace.""

As the evening call to prayer rings out across the Tenggulun village, prayer mats are rolled out in a square at the side of the village's main mosque. They are just next to the office of Circle of Peace, the foundation Ali Fauzi set up in 2016 to divert people away from extremism.

The prayer event tonight is led by two bomb victims, guests of honour in this village which was once the base camp for the militant groups that carried out the attacks that destroyed their lives.

""I often bring victims to the community,"" Ali Fauzi says, ""as meeting them was the thing that destroyed my ego.""

On the screen on the side of the stage a graphic video shows the aftermath of all the bombs in Indonesia.

It's an extraordinary meeting. In the audience are police who arrested members of this community, as well as those who have served time in jail on terrorism offences.

They are listening to the victims of the bombing talk, through tears, about the pain they have suffered.

In the audience is 33-year-old Zulia Mahendra. He was a teenager when his father, Amrozi, was arrested, sentenced to death and then later executed for the Bali bombing.

Amrozi was dubbed the ""smiling assassin"" by the media because he showed no remorse during the trial, grinning throughout and defiant to his death.

Crossing divides

A season of stories about bringing people together in a fragmented world.

After the meeting, Mahendra greets the two bomb victims. They hug and hold hands, and he repeatedly says sorry.

""I want to say sorry, not because I am wrong. But he was my father and these are the victims of my family's actions. I have a responsibility to say sorry, on behalf of my father.""

Image caption Zulia Mahendra was 16 when his father was arrested and then later executed for the Bali bombing

Mahendra, too, has gone through an astonishing transformation.

""When my father was executed, I wanted revenge. I wanted to learn how to make bombs too,"" he admits.

""But over time and with guidance from my uncles - Ali Fauzi and Ali Imron - they made me realise it was the wrong thing to do. And I joined their project to help other terrorists change.""

Image caption Zulia Mahendra with his son

""How I became who I am today was a very, very long journey,"" says Mahendra.

""But I came to a place where I understood that jihad is not killing people or fighting, it can mean working hard for your family.""

One night, Mahendra says, he looked tearfully at his sleeping child and thought about his father.

""I didn't want my child to have to go through what I have. If I continued on my father's path, my child too would be abandoned. I knew that the right jihad was to look after them - to protect them.""

But he says he has friends who have joined splinter militant groups in Indonesia, loosely linked to the Islamic State (IS) group.

""There are lots of reasons why a person goes in that direction - their economic situation, not having anything to do... what they are taught and who they are influenced by.""

Ali Fauzi knocks at the door of the Lamongan jail. This is a familiar place for him, having come here many times to meet family members serving time but also to work with new inmates to try and turn their life around.

""My deradicalisation work is not based on theory. It's from life experience. I was a fighter and a terrorist, so I come into the cells as a friend.""

But he faces resistance and is viewed by some as a traitor for working with the police.

""They say that I am even more of a kafir [unbeliever] than the police or jail guards. I regularly face online abuse and threatening phone calls. But it's okay. I can handle it,"" he says with a smile.

""Out of the 98 people we have worked with since 2016, two have come out of jail and gone straight back to their militant ways.""

""Deradicalisation is not easy because you are dealing with people's emotions and way of thinking, you have to give them the right medicine. And sometimes we get it wrong.""

Sometimes they get it right.

Sumarno, he says, is one of his success stories.

He takes me to a dry field, at the side of the road outside the village. It was here that Sumarno says he hid weapons belonging to Jemaah Islamiyah, after the Bali bombing.

After serving a three-year jail sentence, Ali Fauzi helped Sumarno set up a small business - a travel company offering pilgrimage packages to Mecca.

""Now I want to give back to society,"" says Sumarno. ""With this travel company, I hope that I can leave a life of violence behind me.""

Sitting in his smart air-conditioned office in Paciran, a 20-minute drive from the village, he says he was nervous at first about telling his clients about his violent past, even careful not to say which village he was from.

But now he starts the tour with what he calls his story of redemption.

""I say I am the cousin of Ali Gufron and Amrozi who were executed for carrying out the Bali bombings. I tell them: 'I was part of their group. But thanks be to Allah I have been healed from that rotten way of thinking. And I am your tour guide to Mecca.'""

In a room at the side of the village mosque, an after-school club takes place. Children dressed in colourful clothes recite the Koran.

Some of their parents are behind bars on terrorism charges.

The teachers include Ali Fauzi's wife, Lulu, and Zumrottin Nisa, who is married to Ali Imron.

""We stress to them that not everyone believes the same thing,"" says Lulu.

""That there are people in our community who are non-Muslim and we have to treat them with respect as long as they don't try to interfere with our faith.""

But she says they haven't convinced everyone.

""There are those for and against our new mission. Those that are still militant don't like us now. They stay away from us,"" she says.

""We used to be one group with the same mission but we changed after the Bali bombing killed so many innocent people, many of them Muslims. There are others who haven't changed.""

In May last year, a family of suicide bombers attacked three churches in East Java.

The father went after one, his teenage sons went after another, and his wife and two daughters, age 12 and nine, blew themselves up at the third.

The attackers were part of the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) network, which is loosely linked to IS.

JAD has carried out a series of lone wolf attacks against Indonesian security forces and religious minorities. The most recent was a knife attack, by a young couple, against the country's top security officer, Wiranto.

In the Circle of Peace office, Lulu Fauzi says she is shocked women are taking such an active part.

""My husband is working hard to make sure former terrorism inmates don't go back. He is bringing them together and he has been able to turn around many people.

""But many people are still radical. We can never really wipe it out,"" she says.

As we drive through the village, Ali Fauzi's phone is constantly ringing.

He takes a call from someone who has recently been released, having served time on terrorism charges. The person needs help getting housing.

Another call is from a mother whose son is being questioned by the police.

""Dozens of people from our community went to fight with the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq,"" he says. ""Not long ago, a member of IS was detained by the police here. So militant groups still exist and they still threaten Indonesia.""

Now he's on the side of what he describes as a battle against extremism and intolerance.

""If we work hard and involve the whole community, then I am still hopeful that we can win this war.""","Image caption Ali Fauzi is now helping others turn their backs on extremism and intolerance""I am an expert bomb maker.
""I saw it on TV and I was shocked, there were so many dead bodies,"" says Ali Fauzi.
""I often bring victims to the community,"" Ali Fauzi says, ""as meeting them was the thing that destroyed my ego.""
""But over time and with guidance from my uncles - Ali Fauzi and Ali Imron - they made me realise it was the wrong thing to do.

122,Coronavirus: Call for clear face masks to be 'the norm',https://bbc.com/news/world-52764355,"['Jasmine Taylor-Coleman', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Main dans la Main Image caption Kelly Morellon (right) and her mother Sylvie have designed a face mask with a transparent window

It's now part of daily life for many of us - struggling to work out what someone in a supermarket or at work is saying when they're wearing a face mask.

But for people who are deaf or have hearing loss, masks can prevent them understanding anything at all.

""You might as well be speaking in French,"" says Fizz Izagaren, a paediatric doctor in the UK who has been profoundly deaf since the age of two.

""I can hear one or two words but it's random, it makes no sense… When someone is wearing a face mask I've lost the ability to lip read and I've lost facial expressions - I have lost the key things that make a sentence.""

It is a problem she shares with the some 466 million people around the world who, according to the World Health Organization, have disabling hearing loss.

Standard face masks, which have become widespread as countries try to stop the spread of coronavirus, muffle words and obscure the mouth.

But now charities and manufacturers alike are coming up with a solution.

Image caption Fizz Izagaren says she feels isolated when everyone around her is wearing a standard mask

Main dans la Main (Hand in Hand), an association which supports deaf and hearing impaired people in Chevrières, northern France, is among the organisations around the world that have created a mask with a transparent window.

Its founder Kelly Morellon worked with her mother Sylvie to devise a design that covers the nose but makes the mouth visible, and can be washed at a high temperature to reduce infection.

""The basic aim of these transparent masks is to allow deaf and hearing impaired people to read the lips of someone speaking to them,"" Kelly told the BBC.

""But they are also very useful for autistic people, people with learning difficulties and small children who might be scared of masks or need to be able to see facial expressions.

""In any case, a transparent mask allows you to see each other's smiles, and at this sad time this could not be more important.""

Image caption The clear screen in Kelly Morellon's design can be removed so the cloth can be washed

Unlike some companies around the world - in Scotland, the US and Indonesia, for instance - Kelly and her mother are not able to produce their masks on a commercial basis.

Instead, they are advising people on how to make their own and there are multiple guidelines online to help. Their top tip is to use a little washing up soap to stop the plastic screen fogging up.

But one setting where homemade masks are not suitable - but where both PPE and communication are vital - is in hospitals.

There is just one company in the US that has secured Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to make clear masks for clinical use.

Five hundred of these masks are being used at Brigham and Women's hospital in the US city of Boston. At the moment they are being reserved for staff to wear when they are speaking to patients with hearing loss, or vice versa. Sign language interpreters, who use facial expressions and lip movements alongside body movements to create more complex and culturally rich signs, also wear them.

Image copyright Brigham and Women’s Hospital Image caption James Wiggins, an American Sign Language interpreter, is among the staff at the Brigham who have been wearing the transparent masks

""When we saw the Covid-19 pandemic beginning… we soon realised there was going to be a challenge because of the escalated use of PPE and how that would create communication barriers,"" said Dr Cheri Blauwet, who leads the disability task force at the Brigham.

""We've had glowing feedback from patients and we're getting broader requests from other parts of the hospital, especially the paediatric floors.""

In the UK, there are no approved manufacturers providing clear masks to hospitals. And the sole US manufacturer is not taking any more orders as it deals with overwhelming demand.

Fizz Izagaren, a paediatric registrar at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey in the UK who is also deaf, says standard masks prevent her from taking patients' histories verbally. She also says she feels isolated at work because she is not able to speak to her colleagues.

""Clear masks should be the norm for everyone in a healthcare setting,"" she says.

Image copyright EPA Image caption The elderly are both more at risk from coronavirus and more likely to have hearing loss

She is now working with a product designer to try to come up with a mask that the NHS could use widely. But even once a design and a manufacturer are found, this could take time to roll out.

In the meantime, there are concerns the current PPE could stop medical staff getting the required consent from patients.

An intensive care nurse working in London, who is profoundly deaf, told the BBC she had one experience where a patient, who also had hearing loss, was not able to understand her or her colleagues when they were explaining a procedure. The patient could not give consent and the procedure could not go ahead.

""[Clear masks] would make things a lot easier for me,"" she said.

""I would be able to do my jobs properly and safely. I would have more independence rather than having to rely on others.""

In the UK, eight charities have written to NHS bosses calling for clear masks to be commissioned, warning of ""potentially dangerous situations"" arising from communication problems. NHS England has not yet responded to the letter, or to the BBC's request for comment.

The UK government says it is supporting CARDMEDIC, which provides digital flashcards and other communication aids to NHS Trusts. There are also apps that transcribe speech into text on a mobile phone.

But deaf workers say these workarounds are not always suitable for sensitive or emergency situations.

""As masks become more widespread in the community - it's going to get harder and harder,"" Dr Izagaren says.

""I'm worried the public are going to get more and more frustrated and there will be more discrimination towards the deaf community.""

It is not just people with hearing loss who could benefit, she says.

Experts suggest that other professions such as taxi drivers or even teachers may find clear masks useful as the coronavirus crisis continues.

123,'I left my campervan in Argentina',https://bbc.com/news/stories-52790108,[],"Image copyright Radka and Ivar

Imagine breaking free. You sell your possessions, buy a van, pack it with what you need, and go. For months or years you live a frugal life, going wherever you want. But for thousands who made this dream a reality, coronavirus brought them to a sudden halt, writes Paula Dear, and left them stranded with a van and a vanload of kit on the far side of the world.

For Radka and Ivar the plan began to form when they met in 2016. Both working as personal carers for a disabled man in Trondheim, central Norway, they would cross paths as she finished the night shift and he took over for the day.

""We met for like five minutes, to change the shift. I was very charming in the morning,"" jokes Radka.

""And then you would stay for breakfast sometimes,"" Ivar adds.

Radka was the more experienced traveller. She had previously hitchhiked from Russia to south-east Asia and was preparing to do the same from Argentina to Alaska. But after falling in love with Ivar, who was in the process of retraining as a nurse, she faced a dilemma.

""There were lots of conversations. I said, 'You have to promise me that once you're done studying you'll go with me.' It was a deal-breaker, and Ivar adopted my dream very quickly!"" she says.

In the meantime, Radka took a six-week trip to Patagonia with a friend, and at one point hitched a lift with a woman called Silvia from Ushuaia in Argentina, the world's southernmost city. They stayed in touch, and three years later this would turn out to be a critical stroke of luck.

Radka and Ivar's plan slowly morphed from backpacking to travelling the Americas by van, and they picked up a second-hand Toyota Hiace. With help from Radka's dad, they built a basic bed and kitchen in the back, and storage for their gear - including climbing and freediving equipment, bicycles and an inflatable canoe.

""We needed a van because Ivar has a shedload of sports stuff,"" says Radka. ""But also it's the freedom of it. When we are inside the van, with gas for two months and food for several weeks, we can be totally off grid. We thought it would be great to have comfort and the ability to drive wherever we want.""

Image copyright Radka and Ivar

Ivar, who'd previously been a climbing instructor, studied hard for his nursing degree and they worked ""every single job that came our way"" to save money, says Radka, who would often finish a nightshift and go on to do cleaning jobs before having four hours off ahead of the next nightshift.

She developed terrible sleeping problems, she says: ""I burnt out and made myself ill. But I did it because I had a dream, and I wanted to make it come true.""

In the flurry of preparations, they were still making last-minute modifications to the van on the day they drove it to the port in Germany for its voyage across the Atlantic and through the Panama Canal to Chile.

Six weeks later, in early January they were in San Antonio to collect it and begin their epic journey. It was the height of summer and their plan was to loop down at a leisurely pace to the southern tip of Argentina - the symbolic start of their one-to-two year trip - and then drive north, all the way to Alaska.

So, stopping frequently, they slowly headed south, enjoying hikes in the Chilean island of Chiloé and Argentinian trekking hub of El Chaltén, and a trip to the 5km-wide Perito Moreno glacier. Camping out in nature soon started to smooth out Radka's erratic sleeping patterns.

El Chaltén was ""absolutely amazing"", says Radka, who had long fantasised about photographing the famous fiery reds and burnt oranges and yellows of the Patagonian autumn, which by this time was already beginning.

""But the weather forecast was bad, so we said, 'Let's go to Ushuaia and when we come back this way it's going to be even nicer colours,'"" Ivar says.

By this stage they were hearing reports of Covid lockdowns in Europe, but were reassured by friends in Argentina and Chile that similar moves seemed unlikely there.

""We were discussing whether we should go to Ushuaia or not, because it's locked in with a Chilean part above it. But there really wasn't any news, and when we asked people they said it was just recommended to wash your hands, no more. So we decided to go. And then it all happened really quickly and we couldn't get back out,"" says Ivar.

Image copyright Radka and Ivar

Hours after they arrived on 15 March, the borders unexpectedly closed, trapping them on the Argentinian side of Tierra del Fuego island, which can only be exited via a Chilean ferry.

With people being ordered to stay at home or in hotels they decided to drive out of the city and wait out the initial 14-day lockdown in their van. As camping was banned, they had to conceal their plans from the police when they encountered a checkpoint at the edge of Ushuaia. An hour north, at a forest lake called Laguna Margarita, they found a spot to wild-camp.

""We were afraid someone would see us and report us. But we were really deep in the woods, and nobody came,"" says Ivar.

When the weather allowed, they paddled on the lake or went running. Ivar taught Radka how to rope-climb in the trees. It was tough going at times, too. The wind and rain often forced them inside and there wasn't enough sun to replenish their solar-generated electricity. On day two they ran out of cooking gas, and they were washing in near-freezing water.

But they weren't too worried. Once the two-week confinement was over, they would return to El Chaltén and wait out the crisis - they could happily spend months hiking in the national park's mountains. The lack of gas, however, forced them to drive back towards Ushuaia, and when they picked up a phone signal again it became obvious the crisis was deepening. National parks had closed. They read increasingly desperate reports from fellow nomads on Facebook forums.

Moreover, they were ""really afraid"" they would get into trouble from the police for camping in the car during lockdown. ""We didn't know how to explain where we'd been for those two weeks, or where we were going,"" says Radka. She messaged Silvia, the woman who had given her a ride in 2016. Could she vouch for them or provide an address?

En route back to Ushuaia they hit a police checkpoint.

""They were filming us and the car, asking where we had been, where we were going. We tried to tell them we'd been camping but we don't speak good Spanish. I'm not sure they understood,"" says Ivar.

""We were so stressed we then took off in the wrong direction. When we turned back we were met by two police cars with sirens.""

The officers weren't pleased.

""They said they would escort us to our hostel in Ushuaia. They didn't realise we didn't have one.""

On the way Radka tried Silvia again, and luckily she responded. Within the half-hour drive she had secured them a friend's rental apartment, and they were escorted right to the door by the police.

Image copyright Radka and Ivar

Two weeks of lockdown in the apartment followed. It was much like those seen elsewhere, with trips to the supermarket or pharmacy allowed, and little else.

""For the first few days we felt OK, binge-watching TV series, enjoying hot showers. But we started to realise this was not going to be a situation for a couple of weeks, and that we really couldn't afford to pay for accommodation for up to six months, because even if they then opened the borders, we'd be out of money. We were quickly getting more and more tired and depressed, and I started having problems sleeping again,"" says Radka, tearfully.

""When you are at home, I imagine you find things to keep yourself busy - clean or paint or bake, whatever. But being in a foreign flat in a foreign country where you were not planning to stay, it's maybe different,"" says Radka. ""You can't focus on doing something new. You spend your day researching every desperate possibility to get out of there. We were even looking at whether it was possible to sail across the ocean! And when each one is a dead end it feels like such a waste of energy and motivation.""

Ivar adds: ""It's like waiting in a bus stop, when you don't know exactly when you're going to leave and it's not the place you want to be.""

But the decision to leave wasn't straightforward. It slowly crept up on them, says Ivar: ""It kind of evolved from possibly going home because it's going to be boring to wait, to realising if we stay three of four more months our well-being might suffer.""

When Radka received an SMS from the embassy to say there were repatriation flights from the capital, Buenos Aires, she felt an irresistible pull homewards.

""I felt a bit like a failure when I started to consider going back. We have friends who are staying. It was like we were giving up. But everybody's situation is different.""

Radka and Ivar are part of a sizeable community of people who travel and live in vehicles for months or years at a time - sometimes permanently - and are known as ""overlanders"" or ""vanlifers"". Some work as they go along, or stop for a while to volunteer, others have already retired. Ask them to #stayathome and, well, it can be a bit complicated. Where?

You might think that as they are equipped to live off-grid, they would be fine during lockdown. In reality, their lifestyle choice depends on the ability to move around, camp, and access services like water, power, gas and toilets. With regional and national borders closed, most campsites shut and wild camping banned, ""outsiders"" being discouraged in many areas, and bureaucratic headaches over visas and complicated vehicle permits, thousands of travellers around the world are either trapped or having to abandon their homes on wheels and return ""home"".

In some ways, Covid-19 has been like a game of musical chairs for overlanders, who have found themselves in varying situations depending on where they happened to be when the music stopped.

Around 10,000km north of Ushuaia, in the Colombian city of Medellín, Berliners Anne and Martin are living in their VW Westfalia camper in the driveway of a hostel, where they can use the toilets and showers. That wouldn't be allowed in many places under lockdown but they happened to be staying there while fixing some mechanical issues, when the crisis began. The owners allowed them to stay and they decided to sit it out in their van.

Image copyright Anne and Martin Image caption Anne and Martin when the going was good

""For us there was never a question of leaving the van behind,"" says Anne.

""We also didn't really see the point of returning back to Europe as the number of infected people was much higher than here. We don't have a home, as we moved out of our apartment and sold all our belongings. We could stay at our parents' places but, in our mid-30s, it's not really our goal.

""The days are getting really long and repetitive. We are safe and healthy, but we are stuck. We miss being on the road,"" she says.

Radka and Ivar missed it too, but they couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel. Luckily, the airport in Ushuaia re-opened and they booked a flight to Buenos Aires. The van and their gear would have to stay behind. But with strict rules in most countries, including Argentina, about how long a foreign-plated car can remain there, they had just one day to work out the logistics and find a place to park it. Again, through Silvia's network they managed to secure written permission from a resident who would allow the van to be parked at his house, and a letter from the customs authorities enabling them to leave it behind until the crisis is over.

""It was a stressful day. We really hope that everything is OK with the papers,"" says Ivar. ""It's incredible how it worked out, although when we parked the van and left it there I was nervous about handing the keys over because we had never met the guy. There's a part of us that's afraid we won't see the van again. Maybe we'll show up and they'll be like, 'What car?!'""

Image copyright Radka and Ivar Image caption Radka on the journey south, in Los Glaciares national park

After they arrived in Buenos Aires, their repatriation flight was refused permission to fly. Just before the next flight, a week later, they were told they hadn't made the list. For nearly three weeks the couple waited in a cheap hostel room in the city, feeling increasingly despondent. They started to question whether they really would get out. Finally, on 7 May, they boarded a Norwegian Air flight to Oslo, costing them €1,300.

Back in Norway, they had to complete 10 days of quarantine, but were lucky to have access to a rural family cabin, where they sat it out in peace.

""We have gone through all the emotions… but right now we're just really happy to be back in Norway,"" says Ivar.

""On a scale of one to 10, the disappointment is 11,"" says Radka.

""The longer we stayed and the worse I felt, I said 'OK I admit it, I can't imagine spending another four months like this, so I'm willing to spend some of our savings on going home to Norway where people have a bit more freedom.' I was going crazy.""

The self-confessed pessimist of the pair, she worries about whether they can gather the funds to return to Argentina and, if they do, whether tourists will still be welcomed under the ""new normal"".

""And I feel like we have lost time. If we start the trip again in, say, January, that was a time when we were supposed to be somewhere else [in our life]. I have a hard time letting go.""

A few months in Norway will give them some perspective, says Ivar.

""We would have felt worse if it was something that we should have seen coming. I think we did everything we could, and I am at peace with that. I feel like we're pretty lucky compared with many other people. I know we will continue the journey.""

'Our car is in Tanzania: we could be fined €1,400'

Many overlanders who have abandoned their vehicles are risking penalties, from fines to confiscation, for failing to drive their van out of the country by the time agreed when they entered. When you drive into a country you usually temporarily import the vehicle for a fixed period, after which penalties begin to be imposed.

Armin and Tanja, from Germany, were driving their 2004 Mitsubishi camper through Tanzania, as part of a planned two-year trip through the Balkans, Africa and South America, when the pandemic struck. Initially hoping to stick it out, they eventually decided to take one of the last repatriation flights out.

""We found a place to store the car safely on private ground. If we hadn't have found that place we definitely would not have left our camper behind,"" says Armin.

Their carnet de passage - a type of vehicle permit that has a cash deposit related to the value of the car - will expire in June. Attempts to arrange special dispensation with the customs authorities before they left were unsuccessful, and they have so far been unable to get hold of the right people in Tanzania to help them.

Image copyright Armin and Tanja

""The penalty for an expired carnet in Tanzania would be €1,400 in our case, as it is 20% of the carnet car value. We are lucky that we have quite an old car but still we hope to get out of this without paying. We will ask for a flexible solution,"" says Armin.

The delay has caused them to cut out the South America leg of their world trip, but they hope to return to Africa by September.

124,George Floyd: What happened in the final moments of his life,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52861726,[],"Image copyright Twitter/Ruth Richardson Image caption George Floyd repeatedly told the police officers who detained him that he could not breathe

The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.

George Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Footage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor.

Mr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.

The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far.

It began with a report of a fake $20 (£16.20) bill.

A report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.

Believing the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police.

Mr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC.

But Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.

In a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but ""he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that"", according to a transcript released by authorities.

The employee said the man appeared ""drunk"" and ""not in control of himself"", the transcript says.

Shortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.

After approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.

Mr Lane, prosecutors said, ""put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car"". Then Mr Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed"".

Once handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for ""passing counterfeit currency"".

It was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued.

At around 20:14, Mr Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic"", according to the report.

Mr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.

During this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd out of the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said.

He lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.

That's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last.

Mr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.

""I can't breathe,"" Mr Floyd said repeatedly, pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"".

For eight minutes and 46 seconds, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors' report says.

About six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.

One of the other officers, JA Kueng, did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but ""couldn't find one"". Yet, the officers did not move.

At 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance.

He was pronounced dead around an hour later.

On the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.

Forgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.

""The way he died was senseless,"" Harris said. ""He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.""","The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes.
Mr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas.
Mr Lane, prosecutors said, ""put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car"".
Mr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.

A lawyer for the family of George Floyd, whose death sparked unrest across the US, has accused a police officer of ""premeditated murder"".

Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder, but lawyer Benjamin Crump told CBS news it was a case of first-degree murder.

""We think that he had intent... almost nine minutes he kept his knee in a man's neck that was begging and pleading for breath,"" he said.

Several US cities have imposed curfews.

The Floyd case has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement.

""The fact that officer Chauvin kept his knee on his neck for almost three minutes after he was unconscious. We don't understand how that was not first degree murder. We don't understand how all these officers haven't been arrested,"" lawyer Crump said.

Three other officers present at the time have also since been sacked.

For many the outrage over George Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socioeconomic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself.

In video footage, Mr Chauvin, 44, can be seen kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for several minutes on Monday. Mr Floyd, 46, repeatedly says that he is unable to breathe.

There have been five nights of arson and looting in Minneapolis and the adjacent city of St Paul. Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said on Saturday he was deploying the full Minnesota National Guard for the first time since World War Two.

The National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - said on Sunday that 5,000 of its personnel had been activated in 15 states and Washington DC. It added that ""state and local law enforcement agencies remain responsible for security"".

In the CBS interview, lawyer Benjamin Crump also said ""we now have the audio from the police bodycam and we hear where one officer says 'he doesn't have a pulse, maybe we should turn him on his side', but yet officer Chauvin says 'no, we're going to keep him in this position'. That's intent.

""Also, the fact that officer Chauvin kept his knee on his neck for almost three minutes after he was unconscious.""

What's the latest on the protests?

Thousands took part in an anti-racism protest march in central London on Sunday, defying social distancing rules imposed because of coronavirus. They gathered in Trafalgar Square, then the crowd moved on to the US embassy.

Huge demonstrations have taken place in at least 30 cities across the US. They were largely peaceful on Saturday, but violence flared later in the day.

One of the cities worst affected by unrest is Los Angeles. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the city and activated the National Guard.

The entire city is under a 20:00 to 05:30 curfew. Numerous shops have been looted, including on the famous retail avenues, Melrose and Fairfax, while overhead footage showed fires burning. Earlier police fired rubber bullets and hit protesters with batons.

US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have docked with the International Space Station (ISS).

Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - edged them into port on the high-flying lab's bow section.

The men will have to wait for leak and pressure checks to be completed before they can disembark and join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS.

Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday.

It was the first time since the retirement of the shuttles nine years ago that the US space agency has sent up astronauts from home soil.

The mission marks the beginning of a new era in which Nasa will be purchasing transport services from the commercial sector. No more will it own and operate the vehicles that run to and from the station.

This will be done, as in this case, by firms like California's SpaceX outfit, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST), slightly ahead of schedule, 422km (262 miles) above the border between northern China and Mongolia.

It was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach.

SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans.

Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers.

SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn contract which will see six crew ""taxi"" flights occur, with the first likely at the end of August.

When Hurley and Behnken enter the ISS they will claim the Stars and Stripes flag left on the platform by the members of the very last shuttle mission in 2011.

Earlier, the two astronauts named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it ""Endeavour"", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s.

127,Coronavirus: The mystery of 'silent spreaders',https://bbc.com/news/uk-52840763,"['David Shukman', 'Science Editor']","As the crisis has unfolded, scientists have discovered more evidence about a strange and worrying feature of the coronavirus. While many people who become infected develop a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell, others have no symptoms at all and never realise they're carrying Covid-19.

Researchers say it's vital to understand how many are affected this way and whether ""silent spreaders"" are fuelling the pandemic.

When people gathered at a church in Singapore on 19 January, no-one could have realised that the event would have global implications for the spread of coronavirus. It was a Sunday and, as usual, one of the services was being conducted in Mandarin. Among the congregation at The Life Church and Missions, on the ground floor of an office building, was a couple, both aged 56, who'd arrived that morning from China.

As they took their seats, they seemed perfectly healthy so there was no reason to think they might be carrying the virus. At that time, a persistent cough was understood to be the most distinctive feature of Covid-19 and it was seen as the most likely way to transmit it. Having no symptoms of the disease should have meant having no chance of spreading it.

The couple left as soon as the service was over. But shortly afterwards, things took a turn for the worse, and in a wholly confusing way. The wife started to become ill on January 22, followed by her husband two days later. Because they had flown in from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, that was no big surprise.

But over the following week, three local people also came down with the disease for no obvious reason, leading to one of Singapore's first and most baffling coronavirus cases. Working out what had happened would lead to a new and disturbing insight into how the virus was so successfully finding new victims.

Mobilising 'disease detectives'

""We were extremely perplexed,"" says Dr Vernon Lee, head of communicable diseases at Singapore's Ministry of Health. ""People who didn't know one another somehow infected each other,"" while showing no sign of illness. This new batch of cases simply did not make sense, according to what was known about Covid-19 back then.

So Dr Lee and his fellow scientists, along with police officers and specialist disease trackers, launched an investigation, generating detailed maps showing who was where and when. This involved the very best of the process known as contact tracing - a version of which is getting under way now in the UK. It's seen as a vital system for tracking down everyone involved in an outbreak and helping to stamp it out, and Singapore is renowned for the skill and speed with which this is carried out.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Early in the pandemic, Singapore was seen as a shining example of how to tackle the virus

Amazingly, within a few days, investigators had spoken to no fewer than 191 members of the church and had found out that 142 of them had been there that Sunday. They quickly established that two of the Singaporeans who became infected had been at the same service as the Chinese couple.

""They could have spoken to each other, greeted each other, during the usual activities of a church service,"" says Dr Lee.

That was a useful start and would explain in theory how the infection could have been passed on, apart from one key factor. It did not answer the crucial question of how the virus could have been transmitted by the two Chinese people when at that stage they had shown no indication of having the disease.

And on top of that was an even greater puzzle. It was confirmed that the third Singaporean to become infected, a 52-year-old woman, had not been at the same service as the others. Instead she had attended another event in the same church later that day, so how could she have picked up the virus?

Evidence no-one expected

Investigators resorted to going through the CCTV recordings made at the church that Sunday to search for clues. And they stumbled across something completely unexpected - the woman who'd attended the later service, after the Chinese couple had left, had sat in the seats they had used several hours earlier.

Somehow, despite having no symptoms and not feeling ill, the Chinese husband and wife had managed to spread the virus. Maybe they'd had it on their hands and touched the seats, maybe their breath carried the infection and it landed on a surface, it's not clear, but the implications were huge.

For Dr Lee, piecing everything together, there was only one possible explanation - that the virus was being passed by people who had it without even realising. This was a revelation that would be relevant the world over because the central message of all public health advice on coronavirus has always been to look out for symptoms in yourself and others.

But if the virus was also being spread by people without symptoms, silently and invisibly, how could the disease be stopped? He remembers the moment, while working in his office, when the reality dawned on him. ""Every time you make a scientific discovery, it is like a 'eureka' moment when you realise that this is something important that you've uncovered, through the hard work of many individuals and teams.""

Spread before symptoms show

What was revealed was what's known as ""pre-symptomatic transmission"" where someone is unaware of being infected because the cough, fever and other classic symptoms have yet to begin.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Singapore saw a rise in cases after appearing to have the virus under control

Along with many others, this study highlighted a critical period of 24-to-48 hours before the visible onset of the disease in which people can be highly infectious, perhaps even their most infectious.

Being aware of that is potentially invaluable, because as soon as you realise you're ill then everyone you've been in close contact with can be warned to stay at home.

That would mean that they would be isolating during the key phase of infection before their own symptoms start. But exactly how the disease can be transmitted without a cough to project droplets containing the virus is still open to debate.

One option is that simply breathing or talking to someone can do the job. If the virus is reproducing in the upper respiratory tract at that time then it's possible that some of it will emerge with each exhalation. Anyone close enough, especially indoors, could easily pick it up.

And another potential form of transmission is by touch - the virus gets onto someone's hands and they touch another person or a door handle - or a seat in a church. Whatever the route, the virus is clearly exploiting the fact that people are bound to be less vigilant if they're not aware that they might be infected.

Some people never show symptoms

This is an even more mysterious scenario, and one that scientists simply have no definitive answer to. It's one thing to know that people can be infectious before their symptoms show, quite another when they become infected but never have any sign of it.

This is what's known as being ""asymptomatic"" because you are a carrier of the disease but do not suffer in any way yourself. The most famous case is that of an Irish woman who was working as a cook in New York at the beginning of the last century.

Image copyright Getty Images

Wherever Mary Mallon was employed, in house after house, people became ill with typhoid and at least three, maybe many more, died of it, but she was completely unaffected. Eventually a connection was established and it was confirmed that she was the unwitting spreader of the disease.

Reporters dubbed her ""Typhoid Mary"", a label she always resented, but the authorities took no chances and kept her in confinement for 23 years until her death in 1938.

Assumptions undermined

Staff nurse Amelia Powell was shocked when she found out that she is asymptomatic. She was at work on her hospital ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in April when a doctor rang to give her the result of a swab test.

She had been feeling normal and safe behind the personal protective equipment she had to wear while caring for patients with Covid-19. But suddenly all those assumptions were undermined because, to her horror, she had tested positive.

""It was a bit like hearing that someone in the family had passed, it was surreal. ""I thought, 'This can't be right, not me, I'm absolutely fine,'"" says 23-year-old Amelia.

She had to leave her post straightaway to go into isolation at home.

""I was worried because I've seen the other side, with patients deteriorating very quickly with it, so I did wonder if this would happen to me."" But, to her surprise, at no point did she feel unwell. ""I had nothing, literally - I was exercising indoors, eating normally, sleeping normally.""

At the moment it's impossible to know how many cases of infection exist but remain hidden from view.

The discovery that Amelia was infected was only revealed because she was part of a study of all the staff at her hospital. It produced the surprising result that as many as 3% of more than 1,000 people were positive while showing no symptoms at the time of the test.

An even greater proportion of asymptomatic cases was found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which had been sailing off the coast of Japan earlier this year. Later branded ""a petri dish for infection"", it had around 700 cases.

Researchers found that three quarters of the people who had tested positive had no symptoms.

And at a care home in Washington state more than half the residents were positive but had no sign of the illness.

'No single reliable study'

Different studies suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many cases are asymptomatic stretching from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects.

The upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"".

The risk of 'silent spreaders'

The biggest concern of Amelia, the nurse, was that she might have unwittingly transmitted the virus either to those she works with or to the patients who depend on her help.

""I don't think I passed it on because all the colleagues I work with tested negative but it was worrying to think how long I'd been positive for,"" she says. ""But we still don't know if people who are asymptomatic are contagious or not - it's very bizarre and the information about it at the moment is minimal.""

One study in China which found that the number of asymptomatic cases was actually greater than those with symptoms had a warning for the authorities. ""As 'silent spreaders',"" the scientists wrote, ""asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.""

Image copyright Getty Images

The team that studied that Diamond Princess reckoned that asymptomatic cases were likely to be less infectious than people with symptoms but even so they're estimated to have caused a significant number of cases.

The 'dark matter' of asymptomatic infection

To try to get an answer, scientists in Norwich are pushing for the population of the entire city to be tested.

""Asymptomatic cases may be the 'dark matter' of the epidemic,"" according to Prof Neil Hall, head of the Earlham Institute, a life science research centre, who's leading the initiative. Dark matter is the invisible substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe, and it's yet to be identified.

Prof Hall worries that asymptomatic cases may actually be driving the pandemic, keeping it going despite public health measures. ""If you have people who don't know they're ill while using public transport and health care facilities, inevitably that's going to increase transmission,"" he says.

""Any intervention that's only based on people coming to primary health care when they have symptoms will only deal with half the problem.""

A team of scientists in California believes that not knowing who's carrying the virus without symptoms is the ""Achilles Heel"" of the fight against the pandemic.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China launched a mass testing programme in Wuhan

In their view, the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to find out who's infected regardless of whether they think they are or not. That was also the recommendation of MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee in a letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

They wrote that the risk of asymptomatic transmission has ""a profound consequence for the management of the pandemic"". And they said that anyone looking after vulnerable people - such as health workers or care workers - should be given regular testing.

A similar approach is being adopted on a far larger scale in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic is thought to have begun.

As many as 6.5 million people there were tested in as little as nine days in a mass screening programme designed to detect the disease - including in those showing no symptoms.

Easing of lockdown

As lockdown measures are eased and more people start to use public transport, return to work or go shopping, getting to grips with the invisible risk matters more than ever. At the moment, there is no way of telling who among the growing crowds may be carrying the virus without knowing.

That's why governments the world over say it's essential that everyone cooperates with efforts to trace the contacts of anyone infected and then quickly self-isolates. They also advise that the best defence remains social distancing - to keep apart wherever you can. But where that isn't possible, the recommendation is to cover your face, even with a mask that's homemade.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More and more governments are advising wearing face masks

When the US government announced this policy, it highlighted the discoveries made in the church in Singapore back in January. The logic is that this is not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting others from you, in case you're infected but don't know it.

Many health professionals worry that masks might distract people from hand washing or social distancing, or increase the risk of contamination if they're clumsily handled. But more and more governments, most recently that of the UK, have become convinced of the benefits.

Not that face coverings will halt the pandemic on their own. But because there's still so little we know about asymptomatic transmission, almost anything is worth a try.

128,India coronavirus: Why is India reopening amid a spike in cases?,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52808113,[],"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Within a week of reopening, India has seen a sharp spike in cases

India is roaring - rather than inching - back to life amid a record spike in Covid-19 infections. The BBC's Aparna Alluri finds out why.

On Saturday, India's government announced plans to end a national lockdown that began on 25 March.

This was expected - the roads, and even the skies, have been busy for the last 10 days since restrictions started to ease for the first time in two months. Many businesses and workplaces are already open, construction has re-started, markets are crowded and parks are filling up. Soon, hotels, restaurants, malls, places of worship, schools and colleges will also reopen.

But the pandemic continues to rage. When India went into lockdown, it had reported 519 confirmed cases and 10 deaths. Now, its case tally has crossed 173,000, with 4,971 deaths. It added nearly 8,000 new cases on Saturday alone - the latest in a slew of record single-day spikes.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fast food chains like McDonald's have begun reopening outlets in parts of India.

So, why the rush to reopen?

The lockdown is simply unaffordable

""It's certainly time to lift the lockdown,"" says Gautam Menon, a professor and researcher on models of infectious diseases.

""Beyond a point, it's hard to sustain a lockdown that has gone on for so long - economically, socially and psychologically.""

From day one, India's lockdown came at a huge cost, especially since so many of its people live on a daily wage or close to it. It put food supply chains at risk, cost millions their livelihood, and throttled every kind of business - from car manufacturers to high-end fashion to the corner shop selling tobacco. As the economy sputtered and unemployment rose, India's growth forecast tumbled to a 30-year-low.

Raghuram Rajan, an economist and former central bank governor, said at the end of April that the country needed to open up quickly, and any further lockdowns would be ""devastating"".

The opinion is shared by global consultant McKinsey, whose report from earlier this month said India's economy must be ""managed alongside persistent infection risks"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As restrictions ease, Indians are slowly getting used to the new normal

""The original purpose of the lockdowns was to delay the spike so we can put health services and systems in place, so we are able handle the spike [when it comes],"" says Dr N Devadasan, a public health expert. ""That objective, to a large extent, has been met.""

In the last two months, India has turned stadia, schools and even train coaches into quarantine centres, added and expanded Covid-19 wards in hospitals, and ramped up testing as well as production of protective gear. While grave challenges remain and shortages persist, the consensus seems to be that the government has bought as much time as possible.

""We have used the lockdown period to prepare ourselves… Now is the time to revive the economy,"" Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said last week.

The silver lining

For weeks, India's relatively low Covid-19 numbers baffled experts everywhere. Despite the dense population, disease burden and underfunded public hospitals, there was no deluge of infections or fatalities. Low testing rates explain the former, but not the latter.

In fact, India made global headlines not for its caseload but for its botched handling of the lockdown - millions of informal workers, largely migrants, were left jobless overnight. Scared and unsure, many tried to return home, often desperate enough to walk, cycle or hitchhike across hundreds of kilometres.

Perhaps the choice - between a virus that didn't appear to be wreaking havoc yet, and a lockdown that certainly was - seemed obvious to the government.

But that is changing quickly as cases shoot up. ""I suspect we will keep finding more and more cases, but they will mostly be asymptomatic or will have mild symptoms,"" Dr Devadasan says.

The hope - which is also encouraging the government to reopen - is that most of India's undetected infections are not severe enough to require hospitalisation. And so far, except in Mumbai city, there has been no dearth of hospital beds.

India's Covid-19 data is spotty and sparse, but what it does have suggests that it hasn't been as badly hit by the virus as some other countries.

The government, for instance, has been touting India's mortality rate as a silver lining - at nearly 3%, it's among the lowest in the world.

But some are unconvinced by that. Dr Jacob John, a prominent virologist, says India has never had, and still doesn't have, a robust system for recording deaths - in his view, the government is certainly missing Covid-19 deaths because they have no way of knowing of every fatality.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Indians are venturing out again but its unclear how many of them are asymptomatic.

And, he says, ""what we must aim for is flattening the mortality curve, not necessarily the epidemic curve"".

Dr John, like several other experts, also predicts a peak in July or August, and believes the country is reopening so quickly because the ""government realised the futility of such leaky lockdowns"".

A shift in strategy

So is the government gearing up for another lockdown when the peak comes?

While Dr Menon believes the lockdown was well-timed, he says it was too focused on cases coming from abroad.

""There was a hope that by controlling that, we could prevent epidemic spread, but how effective was our screening [at airports]?""

Now, he adds, is the time for ""localised lockdowns"".

The federal government has left it to states to decide where, how and to what extent to lift the lockdown as the virus' progression varies wildly across India.

Maharashtra alone accounts for more than a third of India's active cases. Add Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Delhi, and that makes up 67% of the national total.

But other states - such as Bihar - are already seeing a sharp uptick as migrant workers return home.

""Initially, most of your cases were in the cities,"" Dr Devadasan says. ""But we kept the migrant workers in cities and didn't allow them to go home. Now, we are sending them back. We have facilitated transporting the virus from urban areas to rural areas.""

While the government has said how many infections have been avoided - up to 300,000 - and lives saved - up to 71,000 - by the lockdown, there is no indication of what lies ahead.

There is only advice: The day the government began to ease restrictions, Mr Kjeriwal tweeted, urging people to ""follow discipline and control the coronavirus disease"" as it was their ""responsibility"".

129,Mining firm Rio Tinto sorry for destroying Aboriginal caves,https://bbc.com/news/world-australia-52869502,[],"Image copyright AFP Image caption Juukan Gorge cave site: Rio Tinto got permission to expand its mining in 2013

Mining giant Rio Tinto has apologised for blowing up 46,000-year-old Aboriginal caves in Western Australia dating back to the last Ice Age.

The Juukan Gorge caves, in the Pilbara region, were destroyed last Sunday as Rio Tinto expanded an iron ore project agreed with the authorities.

Many prehistoric artefacts have been found at the remote heritage site.

""We are sorry for the distress we have caused,"" said Chris Salisbury, the firm's iron ore chief executive.

""We pay our respects to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura People (PKKP),"" he said. The PKKP are the traditional owners of the site.

""We will continue to work with the PKKP to learn from what has taken place and strengthen our partnership. As a matter of urgency, we are reviewing the plans of all other sites in the Juukan Gorge area.""

Artefacts found there include a belt made from human hair, analysis of which showed a direct link going back 4,000 years between the PKKP and the prehistoric cave-dwellers.

'Devastating blow'

""Today we also recognise that a review is needed in relation to the management of heritage in Western Australia more broadly,"" Mr Salisbury said.

Besides iron ore, the Anglo-Australian giant has many mining interests in Australia, including bauxite for aluminium, diamonds and uranium.

Last week a PKKP representative, John Ashburton, said losing the site was a ""devastating blow"".

""There are less than a handful of known Aboriginal sites in Australia that are as old as this one... its importance cannot be underestimated,"" Reuters news agency quoted him as saying.

""Our people are deeply troubled and saddened by the destruction of these rock shelters and are grieving the loss of connection to our ancestors as well as our land.""

Australian Minister for Indigenous Affairs Ken Wyatt, who is Aboriginal, said it was ""incomprehensible"" that the blast had gone ahead, but added that it appeared to be a ""genuine mistake"". State laws had failed in this instance, he said.","Image copyright AFP Image caption Juukan Gorge cave site: Rio Tinto got permission to expand its mining in 2013Mining giant Rio Tinto has apologised for blowing up 46,000-year-old Aboriginal caves in Western Australia dating back to the last Ice Age.

130,China-India border: Why tensions are rising between the neighbours,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-52852509,"['Anbarasan Ethirajan', 'Vikas Pandey', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Press Information Bureau Image caption The area has become a hotspot in part because of a road India has built

The armies of the world's two most populous nations are locked in a tense face-off high in the Himalayas, which has the potential to escalate as they seek to further their strategic goals.

Officials quoted by the Indian media say thousands of Chinese troops have forced their way into the Galwan valley in Ladakh, in the disputed Kashmir region.

Indian leaders and military strategists have clearly been left stunned.

The reports say that in early May, Chinese forces put up tents, dug trenches and moved heavy equipment several kilometres inside what had been regarded by India as its territory. The move came after India built a road several hundred kilometres long connecting to a high-altitude forward air base which it reactivated in 2008.

The message from China appears clear to observers in Delhi - this is not a routine incursion.

""The situation is serious. The Chinese have come into territory which they themselves accepted as part of India. It has completely changed the status quo,"" says Ajai Shukla, an Indian military expert who served as a colonel in the army.

China takes a different view, saying it's India which has changed facts on the ground.

Reports in the Indian media said soldiers from the two sides clashed on at least two occasions in Ladakh. Stand-offs are reported in at least three locations: the Galwan valley; Hot Springs; and Pangong lake to the south.

India and China share a border more than 3,440km (2,100 miles) long and have overlapping territorial claims. Their border patrols often bump into each other, resulting in occasional scuffles but both sides insist no bullet has been fired in four decades.

Their armies - two of the world's largest - come face to face at many points. The poorly demarcated Line of Actual Control (LAC) separates the two sides. Rivers, lakes and snowcaps mean the line separating soldiers can shift and they often come close to confrontation.

The current military tension is not limited to Ladakh. Soldiers from the two sides are also eyeball-to-eyeball in Naku La, on the border between China and the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim. Earlier this month they reportedly came to blows.

And there's a row over a new map put out by Nepal, too, which accuses India of encroaching on its territory by building a road connecting with China.

Why are tensions rising now?

There are several reasons - but competing strategic goals lie at the root, and both sides blame each other.

""The traditionally peaceful Galwan River has now become a hotspot because it is where the LAC is closest to the new road India has built along the Shyok River to Daulet Beg Oldi (DBO) - the most remote and vulnerable area along the LAC in Ladakh,"" Mr Shukla says.

India's decision to ramp up infrastructure seems to have infuriated Beijing.

Image copyright AFP Image caption There have been protests in Nepal against India's new road link

Chinese state-run media outlet Global Times said categorically: ""The Galwan Valley region is Chinese territory, and the local border control situation was very clear.""

""According to the Chinese military, India is the one which has forced its way into the Galwan valley. So, India is changing the status quo along the LAC - that has angered the Chinese,"" says Dr Long Xingchun, president of the Chengdu Institute of World Affairs (CIWA), a think tank.

Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia programme at the Wilson Center, another think tank, says this face-off is not routine. He adds China's ""massive deployment of soldiers is a show of strength"".

The road could boost Delhi's capability to move men and material rapidly in case of a conflict.

Differences have been growing in the past year over other areas of policy too.

When India controversially decided to end Jammu and Kashmir's limited autonomy in August last year, it also redrew the region's map.

The new federally-administered Ladakh included Aksai Chin, an area India claims but China controls.

Senior leaders of India's Hindu-nationalist BJP government have also been talking about recapturing Pakistan-administered Kashmir. A strategic road, the Karakoram highway, passes through this area that connects China with its long-term ally Pakistan. Beijing has invested about $60bn (£48bn) in Pakistan's infrastructure - the so-called China Pakistan Economic corridor (CPEC) - as part of its Belt and Road Initiative and the highway is key to transporting goods to and from the southern Pakistani port of Gwadar. The port gives China a foothold in the Arabian Sea.

In addition, China was unhappy when India initially banned all exports of medical and protective equipment to shore up its stocks soon after the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year.

How dangerous could this get?

""We routinely see both armies crossing the LAC - it's fairly common and such incidents are resolved at the local military level. But this time, the build-up is the largest we have ever seen,"" says former Indian diplomat P Stobdan, an expert in Ladakh and India-China affairs.

""The stand-off is happening at some strategic areas that are important for India. If Pangong lake is taken, Ladakh can't be defended. If the Chinese military is allowed to settle in the strategic valley of Shyok, then the Nubra valley and even Siachen can be reached.""

In what seems to be an intelligence failure, India seems to have been caught off guard again. According to Indian media accounts, the country's soldiers were outnumbered and surrounded when China swiftly diverted men and machines from a military exercise to the border region.

This triggered alarm in Delhi - and India has limited room for manoeuvre. It can either seek to persuade Beijing to withdraw its troops through dialogue or try to remove them by force. Neither is an easy option.

""China is the world's second-largest military power. Technologically it's superior to India. Infrastructure on the other side is very advanced. Financially, China can divert its resources to achieve its military goals, whereas the Indian economy has been struggling in recent years, and the coronavirus crisis has worsened the situation,"" says Ajai Shukla.

What next?

History holds difficult lessons for India. It suffered a humiliating defeat during the 1962 border conflict with China. India says China occupies 38,000km of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary issues.

China already controls the Aksai Chin area further east of Ladakh and this region, claimed by India, is strategically important for Beijing as it connects its Xinjiang province with western Tibet.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption India and China have a long history of border disputes

In 2017 India and China were engaged in a similar stand-off lasting more than two months in Doklam plateau, a tri-junction between India, China and Bhutan.

India objected to China building a road in a region claimed by Bhutan. The Chinese stood firm. Within six months, Indian media reported that Beijing had built a permanent all-weather military complex there.

This time, too, talks are seen as the only way forward - both countries have so much to lose in a military conflict.

""China has no intention to escalate tensions and I think India also doesn't want a conflict. But the situation depends on both sides. The Indian government should not be guided by the nationalistic media comments,"" says Dr Long Xingchun of the CIWA in Chengdu. ""Both countries have the ability to solve the dispute through high-level talks.""

Chinese media have given hardly any coverage to the border issue, which is being interpreted as a possible signal that a route to talks will be sought.

Pratyush Rao, associate director for South Asia at Control Risks consultancy, says both sides have ""a clear interest in prioritising their economic recovery"" and avoiding military escalation.

""It is important to recognise that both sides have a creditable record of maintaining relative peace and stability along their disputed border.""","It has completely changed the status quo,"" says Ajai Shukla, an Indian military expert who served as a colonel in the army.

132,George Floyd death: Widespread unrest as curfews defied across US,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52865206,[],"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters took to the streets of many cities to voice their anger following the death of George Floyd

Curfews have been ordered in cities across the US to try to stem unrest sparked by the death of a black man in police custody.

But they have been defied in many areas, with shops looted, cars burned and buildings attacked. Riot police have used tear gas and rubber bullets.

President Donald Trump urged ""healing"" over the death of George Floyd but said he could not allow mobs to dominate.

A white ex-policeman is charged with murdering Mr Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis.

Derek Chauvin, 44, is due to appear in court on Monday.

In video footage, Mr Chauvin can be seen kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for several minutes on Monday. Mr Floyd repeatedly says that he is unable to breathe.

Three other officers present at the time have also since been sacked.

The Floyd case has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement.

But for many it also reflects years of frustration over socioeconomic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself.

A big anti-racism protest march also took place in London on Sunday, first in Trafalgar Square, then the crowd moved on to the US embassy.

What's the latest on the protests?

Huge demonstrations have taken place in at least 30 cities across the US. They were largely peaceful on Saturday, but violence flared later in the day.

One of the cities worst affected by unrest is Los Angeles. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the city and activated the National Guard - the reserve military force that can be called on to intervene in domestic emergencies.

The entire city is under a 20:00 to 05:30 curfew. Numerous shops have been looted, including on the famous retail avenues, Melrose and Fairfax, while overhead footage showed fires burning. Earlier police fired rubber bullets and hit protesters with batons. Hundreds of arrests have been made.

Mayor Eric Garcetti said this was ""the heaviest moment I've experienced"" since the riots in 1992 that were sparked by the acquittal of police over the beating of Rodney King.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police are deployed as a fire burns in Los Angeles, which is under curfew

In New York, some 20 police cars were burned and dozens of arrests made. Video also showed a police car driving into a crowd of protesters. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the situation was not started by the officers, but Congress Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said his comments were unacceptable and he should not be making excuses for the officers.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot imposed a 21:00 to 06:00 curfew until further notice, saying she was ""disgusted"" by the violence.

""I've seen protesters hurl projectiles at our police department... bottles of water, urine and Lord knows what else,"" she said.

Although in most places curfews were observed by the majority, also in most places there was evidence of defiance.

In Atlanta, protesters remained on the streets after the curfew began, damaging property and vehicles. Dozens of arrests were made.

Minneapolis, where George Floyd died, has seen less violence overnight. Some 700 National Guard officers are aiding police and they acted quickly to enforce the curfew imposed there. The Star Tribune said the action had so far headed off the unrest of the previous night.

For the second day running, a large crowd of protesters taunted National Guard officers outside the White House in Washington, DC.

Indianapolis was one of the cities that had seen peaceful protests during the day turn violent later. At least one shooting death has occurred, but police said no officers had discharged weapons.

In under-curfew Philadelphia, 13 police officers were hurt and at least 35 arrests made as stores were looted, police cars torched and buildings defaced.

Overnight curfews have also been declared in Miami, Portland and Louisville, among other cities.

San Francisco is the latest to impose a curfew, announced by Mayor London Breed for 20:00 local time on Sunday, after looting and violence.

But amid the violence there were also moments of solidarity. In Flint, Michigan, Sheriff Chris Swanson took off the riot helmets of his men, laid down batons and asked protesters what they wanted. After hugs and high fives, they chanted ""walk with us"" and the sheriff did.

What has the president said?

On Saturday evening, Mr Trump said that Mr Floyd's death had ""filled Americans with horror, anger and grief"".

""I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking peace,"" he said in a televised address from Cape Canaveral in Florida, following the launch into orbit of two Nasa astronauts by billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX company.

The president denounced the actions of ""looters and anarchists"", accusing them of dishonouring the memory of Mr Floyd. What was needed, he said, was ""healing not hatred, justice not chaos"".

""I will not allow angry mobs to dominate - won't happen,"" he added.

Mr Trump has blamed the mayor of Minneapolis - a Democrat - for failing to control the protests, which are the worst since the president took office.

The president's Democratic Party rival, Joe Biden, has accused him of giving oxygen to bigotry and said those responsible for Mr Floyd's death must be held accountable.

But he also condemned rioting, saying: ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not.""

Many mayors and local officials have been trying to separate the genuine protests over Mr Floyd's death from the violent unrest, often blaming ""outsiders"" for the looting and arson. There have been many reports of residents trying to stop acts of violence.

What happened to George Floyd?

On Monday night, police received a phone call from a neighbourhood grocery store alleging that George Floyd had paid with a counterfeit $20 note.

Officers were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic.

According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started.

With Mr Chauvin's knee on his neck, Mr Floyd can be heard saying ""please, I can't breathe"" and ""don't kill me"".

According to a preliminary autopsy by the county medical examiner, the police officer had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive.

Nearly two minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead around an hour later.

The preliminary autopsy, included in the criminal complaint against Mr Chauvin, did not find evidence of ""traumatic asphyxia or strangulation"".

The medical examiner noted Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and the combination of these, ""potential intoxicants in his system"" and being restrained by the officers ""likely contributed to his death"".

Mr Chauvin was charged on Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter over his role in Mr Floyd's death.

Mr Floyd's family said they wanted a more serious, first-degree murder charge as well as the arrest of the three other officers involved.

133,Amazon UK website defaced with racist abuse,https://bbc.com/news/business-52867334,"['Russell Hotten', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Getty Images

Amazon has blamed a ""bad actor"" for racist abuse that appeared on multiple listings on its UK website.

The abuse, now removed, appeared when users searched the online shop for Apple AirPods and similar products.

It was unclear how long the racist language remained on the site, but it sparked outrage on Twitter and the sharing of screenshots and video grabs.

Amazon told the BBC that it removed the images and took action against the ""bad actor"" as soon as the issue was raised.

The company did not elaborate on the ""bad actor"", nor give details of how many products were defaced and how long the abuse was visible on the listings.

Nadine White, a journalist for the Huffington Post, tweeted that the abuse ""needs to be acknowledged, removed, explained, apologised for asap. Being Black right now is hard enough; we don't need to be called the N- word while shopping online, to boot"".

Another Twitter user said Amazon should have been able to remove the offending messages in minutes. ""They're still on Amazon UK. Extraordinarily poor site administration,"" he said during early hours of Sunday.

Amazon also allows third-party retailers to sell goods through its website, with the company making about half its retail revenues from this.

But the Amazon Marketplace platform has come under scrutiny.

There has been concern about counterfeit goods appearing in the listings, and during the coronavirus pandemic Amazon was criticised for not doing enough to stop sellers inflating prices.

In April, five Amazon e-commerce websites, including the UK, were added to the US trade regulator's ""notorious markets"" report on marketplaces known for counterfeiting and piracy concerns.

Amazon disagreed strongly with the move, saying in a statement that ""this purely political act is another example of the administration using the US government to advance a personal vendetta against Amazon"".","Image copyright Getty ImagesAmazon has blamed a ""bad actor"" for racist abuse that appeared on multiple listings on its UK website.

South Africans will be able to buy alcohol from Monday for the first time in two months, as the government eases one of the toughest lockdowns in the world.

The alcohol ban was introduced to enable the police and hospitals to better focus on tackling the coronavirus.

Alcohol can now be sold from Monday to Thursday only for consumption at home.

The ban was introduced at the start of the lockdown in order, above all, to free up hospital beds. And also to reduce domestic violence.

Alcohol-fuelled violence is a huge problem in South Africa, particularly at weekends.

Doctors and police say the ban has had a dramatic impact, contributing to sharp drop in casualty admissions.

But the country’s brewers and its wine makers have complained that they’re being driven out of business. And the government has lost a fortune in tax revenues.

South Africa is easing some lockdown restrictions, hoping to revive its economy at a time when the infection rate is starting to rise.

Cape Town is currently experiencing a sharp spike, and other major cities are expected to follow suit.

The country is also grappling with a serious shortage of testing equipment.

Alcohol can now be sold from Monday to Thursday only for consumption at home.

The ban was introduced at the start of the lockdown in order, above all, to free up hospital beds. And also to reduce domestic violence.

Alcohol-fuelled violence is a huge problem in South Africa, particularly at weekends.

Doctors and police say the ban has had a dramatic impact, contributing to sharp drop in casualty admissions.

But the country’s brewers and its wine makers have complained that they’re being driven out of business. And the government has lost a fortune in tax revenues.

South Africa is easing some lockdown restrictions, hoping to revive its economy at a time when the infection rate is starting to rise.

Cape Town is currently experiencing a sharp spike, and other major cities are expected to follow suit.

The country is also grappling with a serious shortage of testing equipment.

But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?”

The pricing equation

Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.”

This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.”

The art, meanwhile, comes from “the airline’s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That’s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,” Cany concludes.

But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving.

When will demand return?

In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.","Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends.

191,The surprising perks of isolated work,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200527-the-surprising-perks-of-isolated-work,['Norman Miller'],"For millions of people worldwide, widespread lockdown has cast isolation as a negative – a loss of group engagement and communal hubbub. Yet while many of us are clamouring to get back into the social rhythm of the office, there are people around the world who choose work lives involving long periods isolated in remote settings.

“Some people thrive on their own company,” says Sandi Mann, senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire. “It gives the freedom of not having to worry about other people in terms of their needs or judgements. Others might like the challenge to see if they can cope on their own or to help them adjust to a different pace of life.”

Mann sees solitary times as beneficial contrasts to the pace of modern living. “We get used to high levels of dopamine from a busy, hectic and stimulation-rich environment, but dopamine is addictive. So, to wean ourselves off we need lower levels of stimulation.”

Or perhaps, rather than thinking in terms of lower levels of stimulation, those who choose to spend time out in the world in solitary are actually discovering different kinds of stimulation that crowded lives cover up.

197,Why we’ve created new language for coronavirus,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200522-why-weve-created-new-language-for-coronavirus,['Christine Ro'],"Throughout history, challenging circumstances have given rise to new ways of expressing those challenges. George Eliot, the 19th Century writer who was famously frustrated by rigid gender and lifestyle norms, is credited with the first recorded use of the word ‘frustrating’. More recently, Brexit led to a flowering of new words, including the inevitable ‘Bremain’ and ‘Bregret’, and a repurposing of existing words, such as ‘backstop’.

While Brexit may be the closest parallel, the speed of the linguistic change we’re seeing with Covid-19 is unprecedented, says Robert Lawson, a sociolinguist at Birmingham City University. Lawson attributes this to multiple factors: the dizzying pace at which the virus has spread, its dominance in the media and global interconnectivity at a time when social media and remote contact are so important.

Many of the newly popular terms relate to the socially distanced nature of human contact these days, such as ‘virtual happy hour’, ‘covideo party’ and ‘quarantine and chill’. Many use ‘corona’ as a prefix, whether Polish speakers convert ‘coronavirus’ into a verb or English speakers wonder how ‘coronababies’ (the children born or conceived during the pandemic) will fare. And, of course, there are abbreviations, like the ubiquitous ‘WFH’ and the life-saving ‘PPE’.

Old words in a new light

Like everyone else, lexicologists are scrambling to keep up with the changes the pandemic has wrought. According to Fiona McPherson, the senior editor of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), back in December ‘coronavirus’ appeared only 0.03 times per million tokens (tokens are the smallest units of language collected and tracked in the OED corpus).

201,Why flats dominate Spain’s housing market,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200506-why-do-flats-dominate-spains-housing-market,['Jessica Jones'],"Own your home

Spain may be a nation of flat-dwellers, but it is also traditionally a nation of homeowners. It’s another reason why flats – that were generally cheaper to buy – became so popular. According to Eurostat figures, 76% of Spaniards owned their own home in 2018, compared to 65% of French and British people and 52% of Germans.

New rental laws and economic conditions during the 1960s meant that for the first time many Spaniards’ main goal was to own property, something encouraged by Franco, whose regime attached great importance to the home as the heart of Catholic society. “The apartment responded well to the double need to offer many housing units – in a short time and at a reduced price – and to the desire that it be owned,” says Román. “In Spain at that time, owning property became one of the main symbols of prosperity.”

New-build apartments held lavish inauguration events that included key handover ceremonies and the blessing of the new homes by a priest – acts that, says Román, were “conveniently publicised by the dictatorship’s propaganda machine”. Partly because of the government messaging, for many poor families owning a property “constituted one of life’s main aspirations”, she says.

It also made sense in a country where an inflationary economy meant most people put their money into bricks and mortar. “Financial markets were not very developed and there was a lot of inflation that would eat away at your savings. The best way to preserve their value was real estate,” adds economist Díaz Giménez.

‘Intense feeling of community’

The root of apartment living may be economic, but is there a case to be made that Spaniards just like living shoulder-to-shoulder? For many, growing up surrounded by neighbours has fostered a thriving sense of community.

Marc Pradel, 40, an expert on urban sociology at the University of Barcelona, says the dominance of apartments has “generated strong and vibrant neighbourhoods in most Spanish cities, which has reinforced local social life”. In fact, these neighbourhoods and the allure of living in the heart of the town or city is what attracts many people to live in flats.","Own your homeSpain may be a nation of flat-dwellers, but it is also traditionally a nation of homeowners.

For others – well, the transition isn’t quite as seamless. Some find all they’ve done with their eight hours is answer two emails, dream about a massage or discover their ‘cheese hour’.

It’s true: some people simply have dispositions and personality traits that enable them to better adjust to the new world of remote work than others. However, it’s not so black and white. You’re not necessarily destined to be good or bad at working remotely – some may just have to put in more effort than others.

The pull of procrastination

Procrastination is never easier than when your superior isn’t looking over your shoulder. As long as the status light on your communication app is green, it’s easy to pop into the kitchen and try a new recipe, or get into a YouTube hole, with no one any the wiser.

If it feels easier to procrastinate at home than in the office, it is for most: telework is a “weak situation” with murkier expectations about behaviour, says Timothy Pychyl, associate psychology professor at Carleton University in Ontario. In contrast, he points to a common situation: “In an elevator, we all typically ‘act elevator’, for example avoid eye contact with others, and keep our distance as [much as] possible …. The office is more of a strong situation with expectations for many things such as dress codes, arrival and departure times [and] time spent on or off task.” Weaker cues and lower accountability may make procrastination more likely at home.

And without the strong situation of an office, it’s quite a bit easier to dismiss unpleasant tasks. When there’s a task on your plate you don’t want to dive into, or you’re banging your head against a wall with a tech problem, you’re testing your ‘frustration tolerance’, says Pychyl. Those who have a lower frustration tolerance are much more likely to procrastinate – they’re the people who get up from their desk and find a distraction.","For some, working from home is a gift – a remarkable opportunity to focus and be hyper-productive, all the while finding time to walk the dog and even exercise in pyjamas.

For example, those who are prone to anxiety might read an article to source factual information about the economy, then “go down a rabbit hole” and focus on the worst-case scenario for their own income prospects. “They're saying, ‘well, you know, my job is at risk, I'm going to lose my job and then I can't support myself and then I will lose my house’,” explains Davies.

Others with anxiety may be more susceptible to feeling the pain felt by those who’ve lost lives or loved ones in the crisis. “Our imagination and memory leaves us afterwards rehearsing things in our heads... We imagine what scenes are like for people, how terrible that might be, and those types of things are distressing for people.”

Switching off the news might, however, not be so easy for this group, because “the thing about anxiety for people generally is that it pushes us to check [the information], to try and relieve anxiety”.

For those with depression, the opposite may be true. Davies says some people “switch off and become apathetic” after being exposed to too much coronavirus information, and instead turn to alternative and potentially dangerous sources of stimulation, such as too much alcohol or food.

I was far too lazy to participate, but was fascinated by the spectacle nonetheless.

223,The tree that changed the world map,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200527-the-tree-that-changed-the-world-map,['Vittoria Traverso'],"Unfurling in a carpet of green where the Andes and Amazon basin meet in south-western Peru, Manú National Park is one of the most biodiverse corners of the planet: a lush, 1.5-million hectare Unesco-inscribed nature reserve wrapped in mist, covered in a chaos of vines and largely untouched by humans.

Where to see the rare cinchona tree Manú National Park, Peru: A haven of biodiversity, the Unesco nature preserve is home to an estimated 5,000 plant species. Podocarpus National Park, Ecuador: One of the last places to spot Ecuador’s national tree. Hiking through its misty trails, you may also encounter the spectacled bear, one of the Andes’ most emblematic animals. Cutervo National Park, Peru: Peru’s oldest protected area is famous for its pre-Columbian archaeological remains, 88 species of orchids and for being the last remaining cloud forest in the Peruvian highlands. Semilla Bendita Botanical Garden, Peru: This botanical garden operated by local environmentalists is home to more than 1,300 native species – including orchids and cinchonas.

But if you hack your way through the rainforest’s dense jungle, cross its rushing rivers and avoid the jaguars and pumas, you may see one of the few remaining specimens of the endangered cinchona officinalis tree. To the untrained eye, the thin, 15m-tall tree may blend into the thicketed maze. But the flowering plant, which is native to the Andean foothills, has inspired many myths and shaped human history for centuries.

“This may not be a well-known tree,” said Nataly Canales, who grew up in the Peruvian Amazonian region of Madre de Dios. “Yet, a compound extracted from this plant has saved millions of lives in human history.”

Today, Canales is a biologist at the National Museum of Denmark who is tracing the genetic history of cinchona. As she explained, it was the bark of this rare tree that gave the world quinine, the world’s first anti-malarial drug. And while the discovery of quinine was welcomed by the world with both excitement and suspicion hundreds of years ago, in recent weeks, this tree’s medical derivatives have been at the centre of another heated global debate. Synthetic versions of quinine – such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – have been touted and largely disputed as possible treatments for the novel coronavirus.

For centuries, malaria, a disease caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, has plagued people across the world. It ravaged the Roman Empire; it killed between 150 to 300 million people in the 20th Century; and, according to the World Health Organization, nearly half of the world’s population still lives in areas where the disease is transmitted.

Medieval remedies to cure “mal aria” (“bad air” in Italian) reflected the erroneous belief that it was an airborne disease and ranged from bloodletting to limb amputations to cutting a hole in the skull. But in the 17th Century, the first known cure for it was allegedly found here, deep in the Andes.

According to legend, quinine was discovered as a malaria cure in 1631 when the Countess of Cinchona, a Spanish noblewoman married to the viceroy of Peru, fell ill with a high fever and severe chills – the classic symptoms of malaria. Desperate to heal her, the viceroy gave his wife a concoction prepared by Jesuit priests made with the bark of an Andean tree and mixed with clove and rose-leaf syrups and other dried plants. The countess soon recovered and the miraculous plant that cured her was named “cinchona” in her honour. Today, it’s the national tree of Peru and Ecuador.

People across Europe began writing about a 'miraculous' malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World

Most historians now dispute this tale, but as with many legends, parts of it are true. Quinine, an alkaloid compound found in cinchona’s bark, can indeed kill the parasite that causes malaria. But it wasn’t discovered by Spanish Jesuits.

“Quinine was already known to the Quechua, the Cañari and the Chimú indigenous peoples that inhabited modern-day Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador before the arrival of the Spanish,” said Canales. “They were the ones that introduced the bark to Spanish Jesuits.” The Jesuits crushed the cinnamon-coloured bark into a thick, bitter powder that could be easily digested. The concoction came to be known as “Jesuits Powder”, and soon, people across Europe began writing about a “miraculous” malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World. By the 1640s, Jesuits had established trade routes to transport cinchona bark throughout Europe.

In France, quinine was used to cure intermittent fevers of France’s King Louis XIV at the court of Versailles. In Rome, the powder was tested by the Pope’s private physician and distributed for free by the Jesuit priests to the public. But in Protestant England, the drug was met with some scepticism, as some doctors labelled the Catholic-promoted concoction a “papal poison”. Oliver Cromwell allegedly died of malarial complications after refusing “Jesuit Powder”. Nevertheless, by 1677, cinchona bark was first listed by the Royal College of Physicians in its London Pharmacopoeia as an official medicine used by English physicians to treat patients.

To fuel their cinchona craze, Europeans hired locals to find the precious “fever tree” in the rainforest, scrape its bark with a machete and take it to cargo ships awaiting in Peruvian ports. Increased demand for cinchona quickly led the Spanish to declare the Andes “the pharmacy of the world”, and as Canales explained, the cinchona tree soon become scarce.

Cinchona’s value soared during the 19th Century, when malaria was one of the greatest threats faced by European troops deployed in overseas colonies. According to Dr Rohan Deb Roy, author of Malarial Subjects, obtaining adequate supplies of quinine became a strategic advantage in the race for global domination, and cinchona bark turned into one of the world’s hottest commodities.

Quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major 'tools of imperialism' that powered the British Empire

“European soldiers engaged in colonial wars frequently died of malaria,” said Deb Roy. “Drugs like quinine enabled soldiers to survive in tropical colonies and win wars.”

As he explains, cinchona was especially used by the Dutch in Indonesia; by the French in Algeria; and most famously, by the British in India, Jamaica and across South-East Asia and West Africa. In fact, between 1848 and 1861, the British government spent the equivalent of £6.4m each year importing cinchona bark to store for its colonial troops. As a result, quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major “tools of imperialism” that powered the British Empire.

“Much like countries today are rushing to get to a Covid-19 vaccine to get a competitive advantage, countries back then rushed to get quinine” explained Patricia Schlagenhauf, a professor of travel medicine at the University of Zurich specialising in malaria.

Churchill allegedly said the drink had saved 'more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire'

It wasn’t just cinchona bark that was valuable. Its seeds become a high-demand commodity too. “British and Dutch governments wanted to plant cinchona in their own colonies to stop their dependence on South America,” Deb Roy explained. But choosing the right seed wasn’t easy. Each of the 23 species of cinchona has a different quinine content. It was thanks to locals with indigenous botanical knowledge that Europeans could secure quinine-rich species to export abroad.

By the mid-1850s, the British had successfully established “fever tree” plantations in southern India, where malaria was rampant. Soon, British authorities started distributing locally harvested quinine to soldiers and civil servants. It’s long been rumoured that they allegedly mixed gin with their quinine to make it more palatable, thus inventing the first tonic water and the famous gin and tonic drink. Today, small amounts of quinine are still found in tonic water. But as Kim Walker, who co-authored the book Just the Tonic points out, this British origin story is likely a myth. “It seems like they added whatever was handy” – be it rum, brandy or arrack, she explained.

Plus, as Schlagenhauf adds, quinine has a short lifespan in the body so sipping on a gin and tonic at cocktail hour would not be enough to guarantee protection against malaria. Nevertheless, the myth of gin and tonic as a potent anti-malaria prevention tricked even Winston Churchill, who allegedly said the drink had saved “more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire.”

Of course, the gin and tonic is just one drink tied to the “fever tree”. Today, the most famous cocktail in Peru may be the American-invented pisco sour, but the most popular among Peruvians is arguably the bitter, quinine-flavoured pisco tonic, a homegrown invention that’s often mixed with maiz morado (purple corn) from the Andes to make a pisco morada tonic. If you’ve ever sipped liqueurs like Campari, Pimm’s or the French aperitif Lillet (a key ingredient in James Bond’s famous Vesper martini), you’ve tasted quinine. It’s also found in Scotland’s “other” national drink, Irn-Bru, and in what is reported to be Queen Elizabeth II’s favourite drink, gin and Dubonnet – an aperitif which, coincidentally, was invented by a French chemist to make quinine more palatable for French troops stationed in North African colonies.

Quinine was eventually pushed aside in the 1970s by artemisinin, a drug derived from the sweet wormwood plant, as the world’s go-to malaria remedy. Still, the legacy of quinine runs deep around the world. Today, Ban-dung, Indonesia, is known as “The Paris of Java” because the Dutch transformed this once-sleepy port into the world’s largest quinine centre, brimming with Art Deco buildings, ballrooms and hotels. English is widely spoken in places as diverse as India, Hong Kong, Sierra Leone, Kenya and coastal Sri Lanka; and French in Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria today partly because of quinine. And in Spanish, there is still an expression that states, “ser más malo que la quina” – which roughly translates as, “to be worse than quinine”, a reference to the bark’s bitter taste.

At the height of the global “quinine hunt” in the 1850s, Peru and Bolivia both established monopolies over their highly lucrative tree bark exports. In fact, much of La Paz’s Neoclassical cathedral and many of the cobblestone streets running through the city’s plaza-filled historic centre today were built with cinchona bark, which at one point accounted for 15% of Bolivia’s total tax revenue.

However, the centuries-long demand for cinchona bark has left a visible scar on its native habitat. In 1805, explorers documented 25,000 cinchona trees in the Ecuadorean Andes. The same area, now part of the Podocarpus National Park, counts just 29 trees.

It is to plants that we owe some of the major medicinal breakthroughs in human history

Canales explained that the removal of quinine-rich species from the Andes has changed the genetic structure of cinchona plants, reducing their ability to evolve and change. Part of Canales’ work, in collaboration with the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew outside London, is to look at old cinchona bark specimens preserved in museums to study how human behaviour may have altered the plant. “We think that cinchona may have evolved to contain less quinine because of overharvesting,” she explained.

Recently, the World Health Organization halted studies of quinine’s synthetic descendant, hydroxychloroquine, as a possible coronavirus treatment amid safety concerns. Despite the fact that the drug is now developed in labs versus extracted from forests, Canales says the protection of the cinchona and the endangered “pharmacy of the world” that nurtures it, is crucial for the discovery of new drugs in the future.

In the absence of government protection of cinchona, local conservation groups are stepping in. Environmental organisation Semilla Bendita, literally “blessed seeds”, is planning to plant 2021 cinchona seeds for the 200th anniversary of Peru’s independence in 2021, and scientists like Schlagenhauf hope that more efforts to preserve the Andes’ biodiversity will follow.

“What the story of quinine shows is that biodiversity and human health go hand in hand,” Schlagenhauf said. “People often think of plant-based remedies as ‘alternative medicine’, but it is to plants that we owe some of the major medicinal breakthroughs in human history.

227,The tree that changed the world map,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200527-the-tree-that-changed-the-world-map,['Vittoria Traverso'],"Unfurling in a carpet of green where the Andes and Amazon basin meet in south-western Peru, Manú National Park is one of the most biodiverse corners of the planet: a lush, 1.5-million hectare Unesco-inscribed nature reserve wrapped in mist, covered in a chaos of vines and largely untouched by humans.

Where to see the rare cinchona tree Manú National Park, Peru: A haven of biodiversity, the Unesco nature preserve is home to an estimated 5,000 plant species. Podocarpus National Park, Ecuador: One of the last places to spot Ecuador’s national tree. Hiking through its misty trails, you may also encounter the spectacled bear, one of the Andes’ most emblematic animals. Cutervo National Park, Peru: Peru’s oldest protected area is famous for its pre-Columbian archaeological remains, 88 species of orchids and for being the last remaining cloud forest in the Peruvian highlands. Semilla Bendita Botanical Garden, Peru: This botanical garden operated by local environmentalists is home to more than 1,300 native species – including orchids and cinchonas.

But if you hack your way through the rainforest’s dense jungle, cross its rushing rivers and avoid the jaguars and pumas, you may see one of the few remaining specimens of the endangered cinchona officinalis tree. To the untrained eye, the thin, 15m-tall tree may blend into the thicketed maze. But the flowering plant, which is native to the Andean foothills, has inspired many myths and shaped human history for centuries.

“This may not be a well-known tree,” said Nataly Canales, who grew up in the Peruvian Amazonian region of Madre de Dios. “Yet, a compound extracted from this plant has saved millions of lives in human history.”

Today, Canales is a biologist at the National Museum of Denmark who is tracing the genetic history of cinchona. As she explained, it was the bark of this rare tree that gave the world quinine, the world’s first anti-malarial drug. And while the discovery of quinine was welcomed by the world with both excitement and suspicion hundreds of years ago, in recent weeks, this tree’s medical derivatives have been at the centre of another heated global debate. Synthetic versions of quinine – such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – have been touted and largely disputed as possible treatments for the novel coronavirus.

For centuries, malaria, a disease caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, has plagued people across the world. It ravaged the Roman Empire; it killed between 150 to 300 million people in the 20th Century; and, according to the World Health Organization, nearly half of the world’s population still lives in areas where the disease is transmitted.

Medieval remedies to cure “mal aria” (“bad air” in Italian) reflected the erroneous belief that it was an airborne disease and ranged from bloodletting to limb amputations to cutting a hole in the skull. But in the 17th Century, the first known cure for it was allegedly found here, deep in the Andes.

According to legend, quinine was discovered as a malaria cure in 1631 when the Countess of Cinchona, a Spanish noblewoman married to the viceroy of Peru, fell ill with a high fever and severe chills – the classic symptoms of malaria. Desperate to heal her, the viceroy gave his wife a concoction prepared by Jesuit priests made with the bark of an Andean tree and mixed with clove and rose-leaf syrups and other dried plants. The countess soon recovered and the miraculous plant that cured her was named “cinchona” in her honour. Today, it’s the national tree of Peru and Ecuador.

People across Europe began writing about a 'miraculous' malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World

Most historians now dispute this tale, but as with many legends, parts of it are true. Quinine, an alkaloid compound found in cinchona’s bark, can indeed kill the parasite that causes malaria. But it wasn’t discovered by Spanish Jesuits.

“Quinine was already known to the Quechua, the Cañari and the Chimú indigenous peoples that inhabited modern-day Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador before the arrival of the Spanish,” said Canales. “They were the ones that introduced the bark to Spanish Jesuits.” The Jesuits crushed the cinnamon-coloured bark into a thick, bitter powder that could be easily digested. The concoction came to be known as “Jesuits Powder”, and soon, people across Europe began writing about a “miraculous” malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World. By the 1640s, Jesuits had established trade routes to transport cinchona bark throughout Europe.

In France, quinine was used to cure intermittent fevers of France’s King Louis XIV at the court of Versailles. In Rome, the powder was tested by the Pope’s private physician and distributed for free by the Jesuit priests to the public. But in Protestant England, the drug was met with some scepticism, as some doctors labelled the Catholic-promoted concoction a “papal poison”. Oliver Cromwell allegedly died of malarial complications after refusing “Jesuit Powder”. Nevertheless, by 1677, cinchona bark was first listed by the Royal College of Physicians in its London Pharmacopoeia as an official medicine used by English physicians to treat patients.

To fuel their cinchona craze, Europeans hired locals to find the precious “fever tree” in the rainforest, scrape its bark with a machete and take it to cargo ships awaiting in Peruvian ports. Increased demand for cinchona quickly led the Spanish to declare the Andes “the pharmacy of the world”, and as Canales explained, the cinchona tree soon become scarce.

Cinchona’s value soared during the 19th Century, when malaria was one of the greatest threats faced by European troops deployed in overseas colonies. According to Dr Rohan Deb Roy, author of Malarial Subjects, obtaining adequate supplies of quinine became a strategic advantage in the race for global domination, and cinchona bark turned into one of the world’s hottest commodities.

Quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major 'tools of imperialism' that powered the British Empire

“European soldiers engaged in colonial wars frequently died of malaria,” said Deb Roy. “Drugs like quinine enabled soldiers to survive in tropical colonies and win wars.”

As he explains, cinchona was especially used by the Dutch in Indonesia; by the French in Algeria; and most famously, by the British in India, Jamaica and across South-East Asia and West Africa. In fact, between 1848 and 1861, the British government spent the equivalent of £6.4m each year importing cinchona bark to store for its colonial troops. As a result, quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major “tools of imperialism” that powered the British Empire.

“Much like countries today are rushing to get to a Covid-19 vaccine to get a competitive advantage, countries back then rushed to get quinine” explained Patricia Schlagenhauf, a professor of travel medicine at the University of Zurich specialising in malaria.

Churchill allegedly said the drink had saved 'more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire'

It wasn’t just cinchona bark that was valuable. Its seeds become a high-demand commodity too. “British and Dutch governments wanted to plant cinchona in their own colonies to stop their dependence on South America,” Deb Roy explained. But choosing the right seed wasn’t easy. Each of the 23 species of cinchona has a different quinine content. It was thanks to locals with indigenous botanical knowledge that Europeans could secure quinine-rich species to export abroad.

By the mid-1850s, the British had successfully established “fever tree” plantations in southern India, where malaria was rampant. Soon, British authorities started distributing locally harvested quinine to soldiers and civil servants. It’s long been rumoured that they allegedly mixed gin with their quinine to make it more palatable, thus inventing the first tonic water and the famous gin and tonic drink. Today, small amounts of quinine are still found in tonic water. But as Kim Walker, who co-authored the book Just the Tonic points out, this British origin story is likely a myth. “It seems like they added whatever was handy” – be it rum, brandy or arrack, she explained.

Plus, as Schlagenhauf adds, quinine has a short lifespan in the body so sipping on a gin and tonic at cocktail hour would not be enough to guarantee protection against malaria. Nevertheless, the myth of gin and tonic as a potent anti-malaria prevention tricked even Winston Churchill, who allegedly said the drink had saved “more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire.”

Of course, the gin and tonic is just one drink tied to the “fever tree”. Today, the most famous cocktail in Peru may be the American-invented pisco sour, but the most popular among Peruvians is arguably the bitter, quinine-flavoured pisco tonic, a homegrown invention that’s often mixed with maiz morado (purple corn) from the Andes to make a pisco morada tonic.

229,Sweden’s single-diner restaurant,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200526-swedens-single-diner-restaurant,['Lola Akinmade Åkerström'],"The romantic picture of sitting in a lush meadow surrounded by blooming wildflowers and dining from a picnic basket might conjure up thoughts of Instagram lifestyle influencers, who tend to be mostly female. But for Linda Karlsson, her novel dining idea’s main demographic has surprised her.

“Men,” she said. “It has been almost only men who have booked the table.”

“The table” she refers to is, in fact, her new restaurant Bord För En (Table For One), which opened on 10 May. Located in Ransäter, a tiny rural town tucked in the Swedish countryside in Värmland, around 350km west of Stockholm, it consists of a sole wooden table and single chair set in her garden overlooking a verdant pasture. A candle and bouquet of wildflowers finish off the demure table setting.

The food is a way of sending people to a warm and slow night in Barcelona since we’re unable to travel during these times

The story behind this new venture is as sweet as the setting. When Karlsson’s elderly parents wanted to visit her during the current Covid-19 situation, she and her partner, Rasmus Persson, needed to devise a way of sharing a meal with them without compromising their health. Since they couldn’t sit at the same table for safety reasons, they decided to set up a table outside in the garden to “remotely dine” with Karlsson’s parents while they conversed through the window.

Watching that tranquil scene as her parents dined outside lit a creative spark within both Karlsson and Persson. They realised they could invite others to enjoy this peaceful solitude while still maintaining some social distancing.

And thus, the idea of their single-diner restaurant was born.

Each evening at 19:00, their solo customer takes a seat at the table and eats alone to the sounds of rustling trees and chirping birds. There are no wait staff and no direct human contact. To deliver the food safely, a red and white gingham-frill basket is attached to a rope and served from Karlsson’s second-floor kitchen window via a pulley system fashioned using an old bicycle wheel to their guest sitting 50m away.

You may also be interested in:

• America's 'fried chicken war'

• The Swedish word poached by the world

• The dish that ended the plague

This setup not only allows them to adhere to the current recommendations from the Public Health Agency of Sweden to maintain 1-2m of space between people, but allows diners complete solitude and tranquillity.

Once the guest opens the basket, they’ll find the first of their three courses. To notify the kitchen that they are ready for their next course, they simply need to ring the bell attached to the pulley system. The menu is always the same; changes are only made if Karlsson and Persson can’t get hold of the locally produced goods they’re committed to using as part of their food philosophy.

While Karlsson’s background is in hospitality and communications, their plant-based, vegetarian-friendly three-course offering is crafted by Persson, who trained as a chef in Gothenburg, worked at high-end seafood restaurant Sjömagasinet and learned from legendary Swedish chef Leif Mannerström. Persson’s gastronomic stints also took him to Barcelona, and his cuisine is infused with Spanish-inspired elements.

The first course is råraka, Swedish-style hash browns with thick smetana sour cream, seaweed caviar and sorrel. It’s followed by “Black & Yellow”, a plating of yellow carrot-ginger puree, browned hazelnut butter, sweetcorn croquette (redolent of Spanish tapas) and serpent root (Spanish salsify) ash.

“The food is a way of sending people to a warm and slow night in Barcelona since we’re unable to travel during these times,” Karlsson said.

The dessert, called “Last Days of Summer”, is ginned blueberries with iced buttermilk and viola sugar made from their homegrown beetroots. It’s a secret recipe handed down from Persson’s grandmother, who recently passed away at 99 years old.

“Rasmus knows how to make these dishes at home, so I'm very pleased,” Karlsson said. “And since I can't cook at all, that's one reason why I married a chef.”

Drink pairings are made from non-alcoholic spirit Seedlip with seasonal ingredients such as elderflower and strawberries, and are curated by renowned bar owner Joel Söderbäck, who grew up in Ransäter and whose Stockholm-based cocktail bar Tjoget was awarded a spot on the World's 50 Best Bars in 2019.

Due to current travel restrictions worldwide, most of Bord För En's patrons so far have been locals from Ransäter and the region of Värmland, and the waitlist can range from a few people to more than a dozen depending on the day of the week. While many people have tried to make a two-person reservation, suggesting that their dining partners can sit on the grass to enforce social distancing, Karlsson notes that this defeats the purpose of the solo experience.

“It’s really about having the time to get to know yourself and to truly honour that,” Karlsson said.

She believes there’s more to her concept than just novelty. What was a call of duty to help enforce social distancing guidelines has unwittingly turned into a quiet, self-care movement. With much of the world in lockdown or quarantine, Karlsson believes people are realising they’re afraid of spending time alone, and she wants to help turn the experience into a positive one.

“Our business model is not a very lucrative one,” says Karlsson. “We only accept one guest per day just to be able to really have the opportunity to make our guests create their own space.”

It’s really about having the time to get to know yourself and to truly honour that

For Karlsson, it’s hard to put a time limit on creating that personal introspective space. It often makes her think of American poet Mary Oliver’s poem “The Summer Day” and the question it poses: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” That’s why, beyond supplying the food and the venue, she leaves the exact experience up to the guest, who is free to linger for hours over their meal, read, write, soak up nature, and fully exist in the moment without distractions. There’s no closing time or harried waiter bringing the bill.

In fact, there’s no bill at all. In lieu of payment, guests are invited to make a voluntary contribution based on what they feel the meal and experience was worth to them. Karlsson and Persson were never planning to turn profits from serving a single meal a day, and are instead donating proceeds to Ulla-Britt Henrikssons Kulturstipendium, a fund to support creative mothers set up by Persson. Named after his mother Ulla-Britt and inspired by her setting aside her own creative dreams to raise him and his siblings, the fund awards 10,000 kr (£845) on Mother’s Day, 26 May, to support a nominated mother towards realising her own artistic vision.

As for why their clientele has been mostly male? Karlsson has no idea. “I don't have the answer as to why it's been mostly men,” she said. “But our table is available to everyone.” She notes that women don’t often treat themselves out to solo dinners and maybe it’s time to consider this as one more necessary act of self-care.

Karlsson and Persson plan to keep Bord För En open until 1 August and reopen annually every spring and summer. And with lots of international interest from fellow chefs and foodie colleagues, Persson and Karlsson are now considering expanding their idea globally. They are currently inviting chefs who are interested in launching similar concepts to apply.

“Our vision is to open up more tables around the world and unite our feeling of being alone together,” said Karlsson.

234,Why First Nations communities are uninviting visitors,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200525-why-first-nations-communities-are-uninviting-visitors,['Diane Selkirk'],"The idea of Covid-19 entering the remote First Nation’s community of Bella Bella terrifies Marilyn Slett, chief councillor of the Heiltsuk Tribal Council. Located on British Columbia’s (BC) central coast, the water- and air-access only community of 1,400 is a gateway to Canada’s Great Bear Rainforest, a region the size of Ireland that’s famed for its eco-tourism opportunities.

One of 198 distinct First Nations in BC, each with its own unique traditions and history, the Heiltsuk Nation has spent years revitalising and preserving its culture. The long process reached a milestone with the November 2019 opening of the community’s first Big House (where the Heiltsuk gathered for sacred communal events) to be built in 200 years, and more plans are in the future. But, as it does in many Indigenous communities, the future takes its cues from the past. And Covid-19, which is particularly dangerous to older people, therefore puts the community’s future at risk.

“Our laws and traditions are oral,” said Slett. “They’re passed down by our Knowledge Keepers,” a group of Elders who have learned the Nation’s customs, traditions and protocols. “We only have 30 fluent Hailhzaqvla-speaking Elders left,” she added. “We’ll uphold Heiltsuk laws and do everything we can to protect them.”

Slett is referring to the emergency measures her community has put in place. Like many Indigenous communities in coastal BC, and around the world, the Heiltsuk Nation has enacted a strict lockdown, opting to go well beyond the provincial guidelines by banning all non-essential travel in or out of their territory.

We only have 30 fluent Hailhzaqvla-speaking Elders left

On the roads and in the public ferry terminals leading into the normally tourist-friendly communities on BC’s coast, checkpoints have been set up, manned by Guardian Watchmen who typically act as friendly ambassadors and cultural interpreters. Out on the water, these Guardians are using AIS (Automatic Identification System) to identify, track and intercept any boat that arrives in their waters. Their role is to ensure the vessel should be there and turn it back if it’s not. Shifted to a new frontline, these traditional protectors, stewards and guardians of First Nations lands and waters have begun rediscovering the power of protecting a Nation’s greatest treasure: its people.

Canada’s Indigenous people have always been stewards of their land and culture – but what’s changed is how they now combine Western science and law with cultural knowledge and traditional laws to secure their survival. Often, the weight of this combination is directed towards things like sovereignty claims; archaeology has been used to secure land claims. But now communities, who cherish their Elders for the guidance they provide, are listening to international health guidelines and then combining that knowledge with their own values in the way that protects the community best.

It’s not difficult to understand why the Heiltsuk have opted to manage the pandemic by following the advice of their own leaders and shutting off their community to outsiders. For 14,000 years, they have lived in balance within a territory that spans about 15,540 sq km and extends through the Great Bear Rainforest. Heiltsuk historians estimate that at their cultural peak, as many as 20,000 people lived in 50 summer and winter villages set in ancient forests of huge Sitka spruce, red cedar, western hemlock and Douglas fir.

European contact, dating from the 1780s, brought devastation. “We survived smallpox, we survived measles, we survived government policy,” Slett said. But the onslaught took its toll. In the 1880s, the remnants of the severely depleted Heiltsuk communities gathered into one village near Bella Bella: their population had been diminished to around 200 people.

And then the 1918 flu came. “My mom told me about my grandmother who remembered the ladies crying and talking about all of the losses. There were whole households passing away – and no time for proper burials,” said Slett.

Cultural devastation wasn’t unique to the Heiltsuk. In many Indigenous tourism offerings in Canada, that painful and turbulent journey is something visitors learn about. “Our most effective businesses are built around sharing culture and cultural revitalisation,” said Keith Henry, president and CEO of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada.

Since time immemorial, Guardians have had a role in managing land and water and in exerting rights

More than opportunities to see wildlife, hear songs or learn how people create art or survive off the land; modern Indigenous tourism in Canada is a $1.8bn industry that combines experiences with culture in a way that celebrates the warmth, humour and resilience of Indigenous people.

“It’s not Disney-fying us, it’s not making us like a petting zoo; it’s really just sharing who we are,” said Henry.

Located 55km north of Bella Bella, the Kitasoo / Xai'xais Nations village of Klemtu is also on lockdown. Chief councillor Roxanne Robinson says the decision to close the community to outsiders was an obvious one, as “protecting the health and safety of people is the work of a leader”.

The rugged landscape and wildlife, which includes whales, coastal wolves, black bears, grizzly bears and the spirit bear, attracts visitors from all over the world and makes up a vital part of the local economy. Robinson says that closing their community in mid-March was a hard choice, but it was just in time. Just south, Heiltsuk Watchmen on the water reported they started turning back yachts. American and Canadian boaters trying to flee big cities and those who wanted to hunt or fish (which is considered essential in BC, but not by the coastal communities) had started heading for more remote, Covid-19­-free communities.

In normal times, these Guardian Watchmen would ensure people knew to stay away from sacred sites and to follow wildlife regulations.

A global concern Inadequate healthcare and higher rates of chronic health conditions means indigenous communities around the world are at greater risk from Covid-19. Argentina: Home to at least 35 officially recognised indigenous communities, some have opted to insulate themselves from outsiders.

Australia: Some remote indigenous communities locked themselves down early. They were quickly supported by the federal government, which is using its Biosecurity Act to limit access to essential staff and services.

Brazil: With 850,000 indigenous people, different groups are responding with strict isolation; guarding their communities from outsiders and using traditional treatments.

Kenya: Maasai people have traditionally survived pandemics by isolating deeper into their territory. During Covid-19, many people are currently scattered and isolated.

US: The Navajo Nation is one of the epicentres of the virus in the US and currently has the highest infection rates in the country.

“They are an extension of nationhood,” said Claire Hutton, Indigenous Stewardship Director at conservation organisation Nature United. “Since time immemorial, Guardians have had a role in managing land and water and in exerting rights.”

In earlier Kitasoo / Xai'xais villages, Robinson said, there was always one Guardian Watchman situated outside the village to watch for strangers. While in the Heiltsuk culture, the Guardian Watchmen were informal custodians of the land and water, following traditional laws to protect food sources and conserve the landscape.

While the ancient tradition faded with colonisation, modern Guardian Watchmen programmes came into being in the 1980s with programmes in Haida Gwaii, 200km west of Bella Bella, and in the Innu territories in Labrador. Today more than 50 different programmes in Nations across Canada fulfil a wide variety of different roles, depending on what a community may need.

Hutton, who coordinates a team that provides technical support to Guardians across Canada, says the programmes are as distinct as the Nations themselves, but there are common themes and issues. Many are focused on stewardship and ensuring the protection of traditional food sources. Some have a strong science focus, and Guardians are critical for data collection and monitoring biodiversity or species at risk. Other programmes concentrate on tourism and the Guardians act as interpreters.

The goal of Nature United is to support the Guardians with resources that match their requirements. But manning checkpoints to prevent the spread of Covid-19 has brought up an unexpected set of needs. “Offering conflict training and Tactical Communications webinars is new,” Hutton said.

As the Guardian Watchmen shift from scientific data gathering and land preservation to guarding the frontlines, they’ve encountered pushback from travellers who question their authority. While British Columbia’s Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation agree that First Nations have the authority to restrict travel into their communities, at the same time the province, like many places, has begun reopening, forcing Indigenous communities to protect themselves.

Slett says while it would be better if Canada and BC reinforced Indigenous restrictions, the communities have the knowledge they need and are ready to safeguard themselves.

Following traditional laws, which focus on balancing the needs of the people, the environment and the economy, coastal Nations, which battled each other in ancient times, have come together. In an effort to keep out outsiders, Haida Gwaii and the Central and North Coast, including the Heiltsuk and Kitasoo / Xai'xais Nations, have set up a coalition. They are working collectively to let visitors know that while they are valued and wanted, now is not the time to visit. The communities are simply too vulnerable to risk any loss.

We are self-isolating at this time so that when we gather again, nobody is left behind

“We know that this isn’t over and it’s going to be a few years before there’s a vaccination and it’s no longer a threat to humankind,” Slett said. “Indigenous communities cannot be left on the sidelines and on the fringes of what’s going on. We need to work together as we uphold our measures.”

Meanwhile the Heiltsuk – and other locked-down communities that have closed their borders ­– have turned inward. “We have Guardian Watchmen that are out there daily. We also have a patrol that monitors the entry points of the community,” said Slett. “And we’re turning to our Knowledge Keepers to see what we can do in terms of adapting during this period.”

What the Knowledge Keepers are teaching is the value of self-sufficiency. All along the coast, communities are relying more heavily on traditional marine foods like eulachon oil, smoked salmon, fresh herring eggs and roasted seaweed. Community gardens are being started and leaders are encouraging people to find strength in the power of looking after themselves.

“If you look through our histories, I can’t imagine our ancestors or our leadership of 30, 40, 50, 100 years ago having the kind of confidence to determine our future this directly,” said Henry. While the financial implications of shutting down tourism will hurt communities, he added, the whole point of tourism all along has been to strengthen the culture: Nations making their own decisions does that.

Slett said that they want tourists, they want visitors, but later. Right now, they need to get everyone through the pandemic safely: “One of our staff members posted this on Facebook: “We are self-isolating at this time so that when we gather again, nobody is left behind.”

237,Cacio e pepe: Italy’s beloved three-ingredient pasta dish,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200512-cacio-e-pepe-italys-beloved-3-ingredient-pasta-dish,['Emily Monaco'],"Cacio e pepe is a dish of only three ingredients, two of which are evident at first glance to anyone familiar with Roman dialect. Cacio is Romanesco for sheep’s milk cheese. Along with pepe, or black pepper, the cheese – ideally Pecorino – unites with pasta (and a hefty dose of starchy cooking water) to form a rich, creamy sauce that is as delicious as it is difficult to perfect.

""[It's] as delicious as it is difficult to perfect.

According to legend, the dish first appeared centuries ago among shepherds spending the spring and summer months in the grazing meadows of the Apennine Mountains, which traverse the Italian peninsula. While keeping watch over their flocks, shepherds would tap into personal stores of dried pasta and pepper; cheap, easy to transport and resistant to spoilage, these two ingredients were combined with the cheese (made from milk of the herders’ flocks) to make a delicious, simple dish that kept them warm on cold evenings.

“Black pepper directly stimulates the heat receptors and helped the shepherds to protect themselves from the cold,” explained Alessandra Argiolas, marketing manager for Sardinian Pecorino producers Argiolas Formaggi. “And the pasta guaranteed a lot of energy.”

But according to Angelo Carotenuto, a native Roman and owner and manager of LivItaly Tours, cacio e pepe’s origin may be a bit less romantic. Carotenuto and local guide Dario Bartoli recently took to the internet with a LivTalk, “sort of like a TedTalk gone late-night show” as described by Carotenuto, to profile this and other local pasta dishes.

According to them, dishes like cacio e pepe, carbonara (a rich sauce made with a combination of beaten egg and dry-cured guanciale or pork cheek) and amatriciana (made with guanciale, tomato and Pecorino cheese) likely got their start, not in the mountains, but in the mines and factories that once surrounded the Lazio region encompassing Rome, near where low-income families once lived.

Dried cheese, dried guanciale and dried pasta were filling, cheap and didn’t spoil easily: perfect for a simple, inexpensive meal. And while the first two ingredients would likely have been used locally for “literally centuries,” according to Carotenuto, the invention of these dishes, now perceived as Roman classics, probably dates to the 1800s, when pasta became popular in the Italian capital.

“You’re looking at the unification of Italy, so the ability to transfer flavours and recipes easily,” he explained, noting that before unification, the poor would have been getting their carbohydrates from bread and polenta, rather than from pasta, which, Carotenuto explains, is said to have arrived in Italy through the Venetian ports.

However cacio e pepe was invented, one thing is for sure: it has captured many hearts around the world, including that of the late, great Anthony Bourdain. In one episode of No Reservations, Bourdain went so far as to say the dish “could be the greatest thing in the history of the world” – and refused to disclose his favourite cacio e pepe restaurant in Rome.

Cacio e pepe has journeyed far from its humble roots. It has been topped with shaved truffle at London’s Fucina; it has been an off-menu “secret” offering for VIPs at Washington DC’s Rose’s Luxury; and it has been prepared in a wheel of Pecorino and served in a tableside spectacle at New York City’s aptly named Cacio e Pepe restaurant. Closer to home in Rome, the dish has gone upscale, appearing on the three-Michelin-starred menu at La Pergola.

But despite its international acclaim and elevated status, at its core, cacio e pepe remains a stalwartly simple dish.

Like many Italian classics, the secret to its success is the purity of its ingredients. To deviate from its three-part formula is to risk angering a local.

“We’re pretty strict about how these things should taste,” said Carotenuto.

For starters, the pasta. Most make cacio e pepe with spaghetti, though the true traditional recipe calls for tonnarelli, a similar local noodle with a bit more chew thanks to the addition of egg.

“That’s what I would order if I was in a restaurant,” explained Elizabeth Minchilli, culinary tour guide and author of Eating Rome: Living the Good Life in the Eternal City. “If I was at home and couldn’t get that, I would probably go with spaghetti.”

Either way, a long noodle is crucial to achieving the perfect texture.

“You really want to coat every strand with the cheese, and the fat from the cheese, and the starch from the water,” said Minchilli. “It just makes stirring really fast easier.”

The next ingredient, pepe or black peppercorn, should be freshly crushed to release all of its aromas. Many chefs, including Filippo and Giovanni Rinaldi of London’s Mammafarina pasta pop-ups, “bloom” the pepper in the pan by toasting it slightly, making it even more flavourful.

And then, of course, there’s cacio, or as the Renaldis call it, “her majesty, Pecorino!”.

“Pecorino is very important because of the flavour and sapidity that this cheese brings to the dish,” they said, noting that either Pecorino Romano or Pecorino Sardo (from Sardinia) can be used.

While the Rinaldis say that, “it should be forbidden to make cacio e pepe without Pecorino”, some do deviate a bit from this norm by adding another, more familiar cheese: Parmesan.

From a historical perspective, it’s an unusual choice, explained Argiolas.

“Cacio e pepe is a recipe of the Roman tradition,” she said, noting that already in 48BC, Virgil was describing the nutritional properties of the local sheep’s milk cheese. Parmesan, which hails not from Rome but from Emilia Romagna, is milder, nuttier and sweeter – the root of an Alfredo sauce, which Carotenuto calls “cacio e pepe for the American sweet tooth”.

But despite tradition, Americans are not the only ones to sub subtler Parmesan for in-your-face Pecorino. Massimo Bottura popularised an all-Parmesan version in 2012, after the Emilia Romagna region was hit by a devastating earthquake. And other cooks, like Minchilli, will cut an especially strong piece of Pecorino with a bit of Parmesan, to mellow it.

“It’s not blasphemous to add some Parmesan cheese to the Pecorino,” said Carotenuto. “Pecorino is a very strong, salty cheese. The starchy water kind of slows that taste down, so in my opinion, you don’t need Parmesan cheese. But you certainly can, especially if you’re giving it to children.”

“If all you have is a good-quality Parmigiano,” echoed Minchilli, “the cacio e pepe police are not going to come and arrest you!”

“It’s pretty typical of an Italian dish where, behind this simplicity, hides a fairly complex technicity”

The ingredients for cacio e pepe may be simple, but the technique requires a bit of finesse to perfect, according to Simone Zanoni, chef of Le George Restaurant in Paris.

“It’s pretty typical of an Italian dish where, behind this simplicity, hides a fairly complex technicity.”

The technique, in this case, is to unite the starchy pasta cooking water with very finely grated cheese to create a rich sauce with no added cream.

“If you tell someone who lives in Rome that you put cream in cacio e pepe…” Zanoni chuckled, “he’ll jump on your head!”

Instead, one must patiently and slowly incorporate the starchy water reserved from cooking the pasta with the cheese and the pasta itself until a smooth emulsion forms.

“Everything has to be the right temperature when you add it together, otherwise you get this sort of plate of noodles with a clotted piece of cheese at the bottom,” said Minchilli. “And it’s just not what you’re dreaming of.”

When you do get that elusive texture, cacio e pepe becomes the ideal comfort food.

“Cacio e pepe is a challenge, but also a dish that’s hard not to love,” said Meryl Feinstein, founder of the Pasta Social Club in Austin, Texas. “It feels like an accomplishment – for me included – when that glossy, emulsified sauce emerges. Plus, it’s made with few ingredients, and many you likely already have in your kitchen, so it fits in well with the need for pantry-friendly recipes.”

The flavour profile of cacio e pepe has spawned dozens of iterations, from gnocchi to risotto to lasagne. There are versions that make life easier, like Rachael Ray’s ricotta-based cacio e pepe mac and cheese. There are versions that make it even more over-the-top, like David Chang’s recipe with house-fermented ceci (chickpeas) in place of cacio at Momofuku Nishi; or the “taco” of cacio e pepe pasta served in a crispy chicken cutlet at New York’s Noble Kitchen. Paris-based chef Taku Sekine of Paris’ Dersou and Cheval d’Or recently posted a cacio e pepe pizza on his Instagram feed, noting that it’s easy to make at home, as “the ingredients are often there”.

“You can make it whenever the spirit moves you, just like cacio e pepe,” he said. “Of course… you need to make the pizza dough.”

For Zanoni, however, merely combining Pecorino and pepper does not cacio e pepe make.

“We wouldn’t call cacio e pepe pizza ‘cacio e pepe…’ we’d call it ‘a pizza with cheese and pepper’,” he said. “There’s a vision of tradition that’s completely different, and abroad it has taken on a completely different vision than what we have in Italy.”

One thing is for sure: cacio e pepe has captured the attention of home cooks around the world, especially given current confinement protocols.

“It’s funny to see how pasta, which abroad has always been perceived as this easy-to-make dish, is changing,” said Zanoni, who often gets requests for a gourmet version of cacio e pepe from his one-Michelin-star kitchen in Paris. “People are starting to give it a gastronomic identity.”

And whether you’re going crazy with new-fangled versions or sticking to the classic, it’s a comfort food dish that tastes great.

“With confinement, we’re coming back to old issues: that we couldn’t always access fresh products, and so we had things that we could keep around for a long time,” said Zanoni. “What better than a hunk of Pecorino, spaghetti and a bit of pepper?”

Simone Zanoni’s Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe

Ingredients:

200g high-quality, artisanal spaghetti (Zanoni uses Neapolitan spaghetti)

4-7g wild black peppercorns (adjust to taste, depending on the assertiveness of the pepper)

160g Pecorino Romano, plus two pieces Pecorino rind

3l water seasoned with 15g of kosher salt

Instructions:

Prepare your mise en place (the French world for having all your ingredients prepped and measured) in advance. Crush the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle. (If you do not have a mortar and pestle, use the bottom of a saucepan to crush them on a chopping board.) Grate the Pecorino with a Microplane (grater).

Bring the water to a boil, season with the salt, and add the spaghetti. Stir gently at the beginning to keep the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

Meanwhile, toast ¾ of the pepper in a pan over low heat until aromatic, about 1 minute. Be careful not to burn the pepper. Remove the pan from the heat, and gently add 2 to 3 ladlefuls of starchy pasta water to the pepper. Bring to a boil. Add the cheese crusts and simmer.

When the spaghetti is half-cooked (after about six minutes), transfer it to the pan with the peppercorns and starchy pasta water, reserving the remaining cooking water. Transfer another ladleful of water to the pan. After a few more minutes, remove the Pecorino rinds, and place them in a non-stick pan over medium heat to toast on both sides. When nicely toasted, remove and set aside.

Meanwhile, continue cooking the spaghetti until two minutes before al dente (cooked “to the tooth” with a slight bite). Turn off the heat and allow the pasta to rest; there should be a bit of cooking water left in the pan.

After about a minute off the heat, begin adding the grated cheese to the pasta from above, shaking the pan all the while to coat evenly. Add cooking water as needed to help the sauce bind; the sauce will thicken as the pasta sets.

Serve the pasta in a warmed dish. Top with the remaining pepper and a little bit of freshly grated Pecorino. Finely slice the toasted Pecorino rinds and sprinkle on top.

The technique, in this case, is to unite the starchy pasta cooking water with very finely grated cheese to create a rich sauce with no added cream.

“If you tell someone who lives in Rome that you put cream in cacio e pepe…” Zanoni chuckled, “he’ll jump on your head!”

Instead, one must patiently and slowly incorporate the starchy water reserved from cooking the pasta with the cheese and the pasta itself until a smooth emulsion forms.

“Everything has to be the right temperature when you add it together, otherwise you get this sort of plate of noodles with a clotted piece of cheese at the bottom,” said Minchilli. “And it’s just not what you’re dreaming of.”

When you do get that elusive texture, cacio e pepe becomes the ideal comfort food.

“Cacio e pepe is a challenge, but also a dish that’s hard not to love,” said Meryl Feinstein, founder of the Pasta Social Club in Austin, Texas. “It feels like an accomplishment – for me included – when that glossy, emulsified sauce emerges. Plus, it’s made with few ingredients, and many you likely already have in your kitchen, so it fits in well with the need for pantry-friendly recipes.”

The flavour profile of cacio e pepe has spawned dozens of iterations, from gnocchi to risotto to lasagne. There are versions that make life easier, like Rachael Ray’s ricotta-based cacio e pepe mac and cheese. There are versions that make it even more over-the-top, like David Chang’s recipe with house-fermented ceci (chickpeas) in place of cacio at Momofuku Nishi; or the “taco” of cacio e pepe pasta served in a crispy chicken cutlet at New York’s Noble Kitchen. Paris-based chef Taku Sekine of Paris’ Dersou and Cheval d’Or recently posted a cacio e pepe pizza on his Instagram feed, noting that it’s easy to make at home, as “the ingredients are often there”.

“You can make it whenever the spirit moves you, just like cacio e pepe,” he said. “Of course… you need to make the pizza dough.”

For Zanoni, however, merely combining Pecorino and pepper does not cacio e pepe make.

“We wouldn’t call cacio e pepe pizza ‘cacio e pepe…’ we’d call it ‘a pizza with cheese and pepper’,” he said. “There’s a vision of tradition that’s completely different, and abroad it has taken on a completely different vision than what we have in Italy.”

One thing is for sure: cacio e pepe has captured the attention of home cooks around the world, especially given current confinement protocols.

“It’s funny to see how pasta, which abroad has always been perceived as this easy-to-make dish, is changing,” said Zanoni, who often gets requests for a gourmet version of cacio e pepe from his one-Michelin-star kitchen in Paris. “People are starting to give it a gastronomic identity.”

And whether you’re going crazy with new-fangled versions or sticking to the classic, it’s a comfort food dish that tastes great.

“With confinement, we’re coming back to old issues: that we couldn’t always access fresh products, and so we had things that we could keep around for a long time,” said Zanoni. “What better than a hunk of Pecorino, spaghetti and a bit of pepper?”

Simone Zanoni’s Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe

Ingredients:

200g high-quality, artisanal spaghetti (Zanoni uses Neapolitan spaghetti)

4-7g wild black peppercorns (adjust to taste, depending on the assertiveness of the pepper)

160g Pecorino Romano, plus two pieces Pecorino rind

3l water seasoned with 15g of kosher salt

Instructions:

Prepare your mise en place (the French world for having all your ingredients prepped and measured) in advance. Crush the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle. (If you do not have a mortar and pestle, use the bottom of a saucepan to crush them on a chopping board.) Grate the Pecorino with a Microplane (grater).

Bring the water to a boil, season with the salt, and add the spaghetti. Stir gently at the beginning to keep the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

Meanwhile, toast ¾ of the pepper in a pan over low heat until aromatic, about 1 minute. Be careful not to burn the pepper. Remove the pan from the heat, and gently add 2 to 3 ladlefuls of starchy pasta water to the pepper. Bring to a boil. Add the cheese crusts and simmer.

When the spaghetti is half-cooked (after about six minutes), transfer it to the pan with the peppercorns and starchy pasta water, reserving the remaining cooking water. Transfer another ladleful of water to the pan. After a few more minutes, remove the Pecorino rinds, and place them in a non-stick pan over medium heat to toast on both sides. When nicely toasted, remove and set aside.

Meanwhile, continue cooking the spaghetti until two minutes before al dente (cooked “to the tooth” with a slight bite). Turn off the heat and allow the pasta to rest; there should be a bit of cooking water left in the pan.

After about a minute off the heat, begin adding the grated cheese to the pasta from above, shaking the pan all the while to coat evenly. Add cooking water as needed to help the sauce bind; the sauce will thicken as the pasta sets.

Serve the pasta in a warmed dish. Top with the remaining pepper and a little bit of freshly grated Pecorino. Finely slice the toasted Pecorino rinds and sprinkle on top.

239,The tiny ‘country’ between England and Scotland,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200504-the-tiny-country-between-england-and-scotland,['Kirsten Henton'],"Nowhere does a brooding winter sky quite like the west coast of Scotland. As I looked across the open estuary of the River Esk, pale yellow sunlight filtered through streaks of low-lying cloud, reflected in the mirror-like ribbons of water and ripples of sand exposed by the retreating tide. All around, fields dipped gently to flatten out along the shore of the channel, which snakes its way westwards to the Solway Firth. The lowland coastline, flanked by rolling hills, expands until the firth meets the Irish Sea, creating a natural break in the land between Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland and Cumbria in northern England.

Standing firm against a determined breeze, I was surveying the scene from what marks the south-western end of the border between Scotland and England. Peacefully admiring nature at work, it was hard to believe that this seemingly tranquil, rural landscape was once at the edge of one of Britain's most lawless, and for a time, bloodiest, regions: the area known as the Debatable Lands.

Today, this once troublesome region is a laidback, quiet part of the border where hardy animal breeds are reared and a sense of community reverberates among the long-established towns and villages. This lesser-visited corner of the UK is also where you can get close to the story of those who called the Debatable Lands home: feuding clans known as the Border Reivers. It’s a place where local histories and scant ruins linger among wooded valleys, fast-flowing rivers and open moorland that lend themselves to letting your imagination fill in some of the blanks of its much under-told story.

And what a fascinating tale it is. The Debatable Lands is believed to have been the last great territorial division in Britain. Here, from the 13th to the 16th Centuries, the region's clans plundered land and livestock and endless blood was shed. Straddling the border, the Debatable Lands flourished as a sort of anarchic no-man's land, not independent but too dangerous and lawless for either Scotland or England to be able – or want – to take control of.

This was highlighted in a remarkable parliamentary decree issued by the governments of both countries in the mid-16th Century, some 300 years into the Debatable Lands’ story: “All Englishmen and Scottishmen are and shall be free to rob, burn, spoil, slay, murder and destroy, all and every such person and persons, their bodies, property, goods and livestock… without any redress to be made for same.”

While this decree was made into law, it was more of a legal “out” for England and Scotland. Neither side wanted the responsibility of dealing with the Debatable Lands; and as they could not agree on who owned it or how it was divided, neither could be held responsible for it, either. As Dr Anna Groundwater, principal curator, Renaissance and Early Modern History, National Museums Scotland, told me, “It was not a valuable piece of land, high ground and poor farming potential, so it was probably seen as not particularly worth fighting for or defending.”

It was also a small area, something that struck me as I examined the map while waiting for a much-needed warming tea in the Cinebar Kitchen in the Scottish town of Gretna. The Debatable Lands ran just more than eight miles across at its widest, and roughly 13 miles from the elevated north down to the sandy-flats of the south with Gretna at its south-western tip and around one-third of the area extending into northern England. Gretna also proved perfectly placed as a launching pad for my foray, only a short detour from the A7, the artery that connects Edinburgh and Carlisle and cuts through the middle of what was the Debatable Lands.

It was probably seen as not particularly worth fighting for or defending

Gretna and its Green may be affectionately known as a safe haven for young lovers looking to elope, but the town also has an illustrious industrial heritage owing to the production of munitions for World War One, which drastically reshaped the community. The architecture reflects the early 20th Century well, such as the once-upon-a-time colonial revival-style cinema, whose adjoining cafe I was thawing out in.

The line between Scotland and England was established with the Treaty of York in 1237. As Graham Robb writes in his 2018 book, The Debatable Land: The Lost World Between Scotland and England, it is “probably the oldest national boundary in Europe”. But when it was finalised, it seems that it drew a line through lands that were essentially familial, dividing some held territory in two. Therefore, the border symbolised state-led authority and the Debatable Lands became the flashpoint of a rebellion of sorts, where powerful families plundered each other in both Scotland and England and neither government was committed to sorting it out.

The region became a no-go zone, a hazardous region frequented by the Border Reivers; “reiving” being a Scots word for plundering or raiding. Reivers busied themselves with a cat-and-mouse style game of stealing each other’s livestock. As Groundwater points out, that this occurred both “across the border and within each kingdom” shows that it was “not only English versus Scottish but internal crime, too”. Although raids weren’t confined solely to the Debatable Lands, most of the bloodiest took place in this untouchable territory, and it essentially became Britain’s fourth country, sitting alongside England, Wales and Scotland: a miniature, no-go area abiding by its own rules.

[It is] probably the oldest national boundary in Europe

The wild, often barren landscape, punctuated only by small communities, certainly adds to the effect. Towns such as Canonbie and Langholm are now local centres for fishing and hiking but grew from the remains of family settlements within the Debatable Lands. There are other well-marked ways of getting personal with the outdoors here. The coast-to-coast Reivers Cycle Route, for example, is a 173-mile stretch from that takes in many Borderland highlights including the Debatable Lands, although, you can pick and choose sections.

Taking another brief detour from the A7, I found myself in Rowanburn, a village with a well-kept public garden and the unmissable imposing wooden carving of Lang Sandy, so-called for his considerable height at more than 6ft, very tall for the 16th Century. Full name Alexander Armstrong, he was the last chief of the all-powerful Scottish Armstrong clan in the Debatable Lands, and a much revered and feared reiver. He long resisted attempts at pacification by the Crown and was eventually hanged with his 11 sons in around 1610, a fate that was to befall many of the region’s reivers.

The place I really wanted to visit, however, was nearby Gilnockie Tower. Mere minutes from Rowanburn, I was soon ambling up the driveway to what is one of the finest remaining examples of a lowland Pele tower ­­– a compact fortified keep built for defence, unique to the border region – and now home to the Clan Armstrong Centre, a small museum and essential Debatable Lands stopping point.

Confusingly it’s also known as Hollows Tower due to its adjacent location to Hollows Village, something that Ian Martin, project manager at the tower, explained as we headed inside the depths of the more than 500-year-old building.

Perhaps because there are few tangible remains from the period, Gilnockie Tower is a space in which the Debatable Lands comes alive. It’s every bit the defensive tower, from its impenetrably thick stone walls to its tiny high windows and roof-top lookout where you can easily picture a guard keeping watch. The tower, which endeavours to open all year, houses a small exhibition and cafe, and, as Martin tells me, offers tours (booked in advance) that “are designed to take people well into the 16th Century, deep enough to give them a flavour of family life at that difficult period”, including, for example, everyday conditions and the daily chores and traditional dining habits of those living through this unruly time.

Discussing my route along the A7, Martin tells me that there’s a desire to see a more concerted effort in attracting visitors to the region: “As you drive up the road to Canonbie, Gilnockie Tower, Langholm and on through the Borderlands,” he said, “the history of the textile industry, both woven and knitted wear, is presented in some wonderful exhibitions [in the likes of Hawick, close to the Debatable Lands]. Much more of these experiences are being developed, all in the effort to open up a visitor route through the A7 corridor that has fundamentally been ignored for years.”

The region’s remoteness, however, was of no concern to the reivers of their day. The Debatable Lands existed in its isolated manner until, officially speaking, 1551, when an agreement between the two countries prompted the building of Scots’ Dike in 1552, which “settled the exact boundary between the countries of Scotland and England,” according to Martin. This man-made embankment, little of which is visible today, was a three-and-a-half-mile-long barrier that finally divided the Debatable Lands in two.

It was initially more symbolic than practical, as this barrier did nothing to stem the flow of reiving. It wasn’t until 1603 that the border areas became a real focus for the unifying monarch, King James VI & I, King of Scotland and the first Stuart King of England, following the Union of the Crowns. New wardens were put in charge of tidying up the region and prominent reivers were rounded up. Some, like Lang Sandy, were hanged, many were exiled, and the process of instilling a semblance of law and order began in earnest.

Winding northwards up the A7, with Gilnockie Tower in the rear-view mirror, I struggled to get my head around how this small patch of land, the most debatable of areas, had excelled at such remarkable lawlessness with colourful characters and tales to boot, while, simultaneously, remaining so very under the radar.

And that’s where the appeal in the Debatable Lands lies; the intrigue of this unfathomable period and, by association, the surrounding towns and villages of the Borderlands, whose natural landscapes remain – almost – as wild and untamed as in the days of the reivers.

240,The indigenous communities that predicted Covid-19,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200503-the-indigenous-communities-that-predicted-covid-19,['Rachel Nuwer'],"Inside the world’s tropical forests, there are the agents of disease that have the power to bring our way of life to a halt. How we learn to live with these forests will determine our fate, hastening or slowing the onset of future pandemics and the climate crisis. BBC Travel and Future Planet explore two sides of our relationship with forests in two stories; this story is the first, and you can read the second here.

Levi Sucre Romero remembers hearing the news back in January about a novel coronavirus infecting people in China. “I honestly didn’t believe it would make it this far,” he said. “I felt like it was really far away.”

A member and leader of the Bribri, one of Costa Rica’s largest indigenous groups, Romero lives in Talamanca, a remote, mountainous region in the south of the country full of meandering rivers, dense jungle canopies and a near-constant drizzle of warm rain. Though the thatched-roof wooden homes of Talamanca Bribri, the group’s territory, are far removed from the country’s popular tourist hubs, Romero soon realised that it was only a matter of time until the virus reached them.

Romero also realised something else: the virus, he believes, was unleashed by human greed and ill treatment of the planet. “We’re unbalancing the habitat of species, we’re cutting down trees, we’re planting monocultures, we’re filling the world with cities and asphalt and we’re using too many chemicals,” Romero said. “It’s a cocktail of bad practices.”

Like Sars and Mers, two other recent, deadly coronaviruses, Covid-19 is a zoonotic disease that came from an animal. Evidence points to its likely origin in a bat, followed by a potential crossover into an intermediary species – possibly a pangolin – before transmission into humans at a wet market in Wuhan, China. While Covid-19’s exact origins have yet to be pinpointed, overwhelming research shows that deforestation and commercial wildlife trade heighten the risk of zoonotic diseases that can potentially cause pandemics. And according to Romero, both are human activities that entail the destruction of nature.

“My people have cultural knowledge that says when Sibö, our God, created Earth, he locked up some bad spirits,” Romero said. “These spirits come out when we’re not respecting nature and living together.”

Romero coordinates the Mesoamerican Alliance of People and Forests, one of the most important land-rights platforms for indigenous communities in Central America and Mexico, which represents more than 50,000 people who live in the most densely forested lands in the region. He knows for a fact that there is another, more sustainable and respectful way to live in relation to the Earth – because the Bribri and many other indigenous groups around the world practice it.

I do not believe this will be the last pandemic of this type

For years, Romero and other indigenous leaders have been urging the rest of the world to adopt a more indigenous-inspired way of coexisting with nature, including leaving habitats intact, harvesting plants and animals at sustainable levels and acknowledging and respecting the connection between human and planetary health. Now, they are reiterating that message in light of the coronavirus.

At a March panel sponsored by the global journalism initiative Covering Climate Now in New York City, held days before the city shut down and later became the global epicentre of the worldwide pandemic, Romero and other indigenous leaders from Brazil and Indonesia emphasised the role that traditional knowledge, practices and land stewardship can play in protecting the planet. These protections, they said, extend not just to lessening climate change and biodiversity loss, but to reducing the risk of future pandemics.

“We are convinced that this pandemic is the result of a wrong use of natural resources and a wrong way of living together with these resources,” Romero said. “I do not believe this will be the last pandemic of this type.”

A wealth of research supports the link between novel disease emergence and environmental destruction. Many viruses naturally occur in animal species, and deforestation increases the odds of people coming into contact with an animal carrying a virus that is new to humanity, potentially resulting in a spill-over event. A 2017 Nature Communications paper revealed that emerging zoonotic disease risk is highest in tropical forests that are experiencing land-use changes, including from logging, mining, dam building and road development. As the authors report, such activities carry an intrinsic risk of disease emergence because they disrupt ecological dynamics and increase contact between humans, livestock and wildlife.

“It’s a stochastic process,” said Erin Mordecai, a biologist at Stanford University. “It’s driven by chance encounters between particular people and particular animals, and what pathogens they’re carrying at that time.”

Deforestation can also spread existing diseases. In October, Mordecai and co-author Andrew MacDonald reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that an increase in deforestation in Brazil tends to increase the rate of malaria transmission, with about six-and-a-half new cases occurring per square kilometre of cut-down forest. The reason, they believe, is that cutting trees creates more forest edge – the favourite breeding habitat for Brazil’s malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Development in frontier regions also brings more people closer to the forest and draws pioneers in from other parts of the country who have never been exposed to malaria and thus have no resistance.

Deforestation tends to lead to these opportunities in which species that don’t normally come into contact are coming into contact

While every disease is different, the general pattern, Mordecai told me, is that deforestation disrupts ecosystems and creates edge habitats hovering between domesticated and wild, in which the human and natural world overlap. “Deforestation tends to lead to these opportunities in which species that don’t normally come into contact are coming into contact,” she said. “That creates opportunities for pathogens to spill over.”

Studies reveal that the both legal and illegal commercial wildlife trade also increase the risk of new diseases emerging by subjecting wild animals to stressful, unhygienic conditions. Still-living species are often mixed together, allowing them to exchange viruses. Trade also often takes place in urban centres, where many people may come into contact with the animals – and with each other – further encouraging a new disease’s spread.

The wildlife trade itself is also linked to deforestation. Hunters and poachers tend to access wilderness areas through roads. As formerly remote areas are opened up by new transportation corridors, wildlife trade tends to follow.

Medical experts and conservationists have been warning of the health risks posed by both deforestation and wildlife trade for decades, but to no avail. In 2003, for example, China briefly banned wildlife trade in response to Sars, but business resumed within a year and has only grown since.

As land stewards, many indigenous groups help to guard against these threats. “By protecting indigenous landscapes, you’re protecting not only those people and their way of life, but also preventing really rapid transformation of landscapes,” Mordecai said. “That rapid transformation has huge-scale cultural and environmental consequences, but also disease-transmission consequences.”

How travellers can help protect indigenous land “Indigenous tourism” directly engages indigenous people to let them share their culture and land on their own terms. According to the United Nations’ World Tourism Organization, “indigenous tourism can spur cultural interaction and revival, bolster employment, alleviate poverty, curb rural flight migration, empower women and youth, encourage product diversification, and nurture a sense of pride among indigenous people.” To ensure that your travel will directly benefit the people whose culture and land you experience, the World Indigenous Tourism Alliance recommends booking indigenous-owned-and-operated tours. Fortunately, indigenous-led travel experiences have recently surged in places like Australia, Canada and the US. In the last few years, the Bribri launched Costa Rica’s first indigenous-operated tour agency, which teaches visitors about the group’s worldview and spiritual connection to the land, with all funds going back to the community.

A large number of indigenous groups live in tropical forests – precisely the landscapes with the highest risk for new disease emergence, and also the places facing the highest rates of deforestation. Tropical deforestation is accelerating and accounts for about 90% of total deforestation worldwide. A 2020 study reported that at least 36% of the world’s remaining intact forests – half of which are located in the tropics – fall within indigenous lands.

Of course, indigenous people are extremely diverse. Some live in cities, others in forests; some extract resources for profit, others use nature only for subsistence. In general, though, indigenous groups “are much more effective at protecting the forest and environment on their lands than most other users,” said Mary Menton, a research fellow in environmental justice at the University of Sussex. In certain parts of Brazil, for example, indigenous protection is visible in satellite images from space.

“You can see exactly where the lines of indigenous territories are,” Menton said. “Deforestation eats into forests around where indigenous areas are, and those areas really act as an effective barrier for expansion.”

Indigenous people’s lands, by and large, tend to be much better protected than other areas of the forest

This is also supported by scientific evidence. A 2012 study comparing 40 protected areas and 33 community-managed forests revealed that the community-managed areas suffered less deforestation. “If we look across the tropics, indigenous people’s lands, by and large, tend to be much better protected than other areas of the forest, even comparing community and indigenous lands to protected areas,” Menton said.

Practically speaking, this is partly because indigenous people tend to live on large areas of land with relatively small populations. But even groups that live in smaller tracts of forest in north-east Brazil, for example, live more sustainably than much of the rest of humanity. “It’s not just that they have lots of forest, it’s the way they treat and see the forest, and interact with it,” Menton said.

Many groups have been living in forested areas for generations and view the landscape as part of their community. Some also believe that their ancestors are part of the forest. Protecting nature, therefore, isn’t just about ecology and biodiversity, Menton says, but also about preserving lives, history and culture.

• The ancient guardians of the Earth

• A 60,000-year-old cure for depression

• The New Zealand river that became a legal person

Indigenous people accomplish this through a variety of means that largely boil down to having a respect and awareness of the effect they have on the forest, Menton said. The Bribri, for example, divide their land into family and community areas, each of which have internal rules designed to promote sustainability. For example, members of the community can cut as many leaves as they want from local suita palms – used to make everything from houses to brooms – so long as they leave at least five leaves on each harvested plant so it can produce more leaves.

We need to rethink the model of development that’s based on accumulating wealth while destroying resources

Many indigenous people also do not treat the forest as a means or impediment to getting rich. Romero, for his part, thinks that hyper-globalisation and consumerism are at the heart of many of the world’s ills. “We need to rethink the model of development that’s based on accumulating wealth while destroying resources,” Romero said. “I see an economic model that is predatory to resources and to nature, that causes a lack of balance in the world.”

However, profit-driven companies, governments and individuals often view indigenous people as standing in the way of economic growth. Around the world, indigenous land rights are under attack by agriculture, mining and other extractive industries. Between 2002 and 2017, Menton found that more than 1,500 environmental defenders were murdered in 50 countries, and that indigenous peoples died in higher numbers than any other group on the list. In 2015 and 2016, for example, indigenous people represented 40% of all murdered environmental defenders. A report published in April 2020 by the Pastoral Land Commission, a non-profit organisation in Brazil, likewise revealed that one-third of all families who faced land conflicts in rural Brazil in 2019 were indigenous.

Menton adds that indigenous people face additional threats because of racism and “perceptions that they’re second-class citizens”. Often, this is a problem promoted from the top down. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, recently said, for example, that “Indians are evolving” to become “increasingly human, like us”. Indigenous people, in other words, are “facing threats both in terms of actual physical conflicts over land, but also cultural threats and attacks over their right to exist,” Menton said.

Attacks on indigenous rights are not just attacks on individual cultures, Romero says, but on the health of the planet as a whole. “When we have rights over our forests and our lands, that means survival for us, for our families,” he said. “But it also means we have a better probability of avoiding pandemics.”

The Bribri, like much of the world, are now on lockdown. “The rhythm of our lives has been cut short,” he said. Visits with elders are no longer permitted, sales of produce to the national market have dropped by around 90%, and the group’s cultural and ecological tourism efforts – including guided trips to mountains and rivers, traditional food tours and home stays on family ranches – have stopped as well. “I could go on and on. There’s a lot of impacts,” Romero said.

Once the world does emerge from Covid-19, Romero hopes that there will be a silver lining to all of the suffering, loss and hardship that it has caused. He hopes that people will be more receptive to the knowledge that he and other indigenous leaders have to offer, and that humanity will begin to re-evaluate its relationship with nature.

“I think we have a long way to go, but after the coronavirus, I have faith that this will open up some space with governments,” Romero said. “After this pandemic, governments should listen more.”

Designed with a courtyard for practicing, and decorated with bonsai trees, it has a serene quality that comes as a pleasant surprise in an area otherwise dominated by skyscrapers and the rush of city life. The garden is used frequently, if not daily, as locals gather in parks like this across the city, mostly in the morning, to practice the centuries-old martial art.

It’s here under the early morning light that a group of tai chi students, led by their teacher, Master Chow, are using the garden as their classroom. They run through what’s known in tai chi as a “form” – a sequence of fluid moves.

To an observer, the movements appear effortless. The students glide and flow seamlessly from one move to the next, exuding a calmness that’s far removed from the bustling streets nearby. Passers-by stop and watch, momentarily soothed by the movements that, although gentle, cut a powerful presence.

“People think that tai chi is just soft. But it’s all things – gentle, explosive, delicate, calm and full of wisdom,” said Chow. “There are 1,000 words to define it, but there are no words to fully describe it.”

Tai chi is a type of ancient Chinese martial art that is widely believed to have originated more than 400 years ago during the Ming dynasty. Chen Wangting (1600-1680), a local military commander from the Chenjiagou village in Henan Province, has historically been recognised as the first person to create and practice tai chi. After retiring from the army, Wangting created tai chi as a fighting art to protect his family against thieves and bandits. He integrated the skills of different martial art styles with elements of the Taoist yin-yang philosophy – the idea that everything consists of two opposing forces that harmonise with each other to create a whole – as well as theories drawn from Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Nowadays, tai chi is mainly practiced as a low-to moderate-intensity exercise combined with meditation, body awareness, imagery and controlled breathing. Its main objective is to achieve longevity through mind and body conditioning.

Tai chi maintains cardiorespiratory function, muscular fitness and joint flexibility

The ancient practice is immensely popular throughout China, but it is particularly beloved in Hong Kong for its ability to relieve stress and improve health. With famously small living spaces in Hong Kong, going to the city’s parks or tai chi gardens is a good way to be out in the open while getting some exercise. Hong Kong also has a rapidly ageing population – about one third of its population will be aged 65 or above by 2038 – and the city’s elderly citizens are encouraged by the government to attend classes in the morning, which are often followed by tea and dim sum with their teacher and classmates. Not only do tai chi classes promote healthy movement, but they provide the elderly with a social community and combat isolation.

Some experts point to the health benefits of tai chi as a reason lifespan has increased in Hong Kong over the last 50 years. Hong Kong has the highest life expectancy in the world. Women in the city live, on average, to 87.6 years of age and men to 81.9, beating such places as Japan and Italy, which are renowned for their longevity. “Prior study has indicated that this longevity increase is associated with the more active lifestyle of the elderly today,” said Aileen Chan, professor at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, whose research expertise is tai chi. “Tai chi maintains cardiorespiratory function, muscular fitness and joint flexibility. To promote a longer life, it is recommended to practice tai chi regularly for at least 30 minutes a day and at least five times a week, preferably every day.”

Chow is the founder of the Chen Style Tai Chi Institute in Hong Kong where he has taught more than 3,000 local and international students over a period of 19 years. Born into a martial arts family, Chow was inspired by his father, a kung fu master, who he describes as a humble man with great power and strength but who never showed off.

“When I was 16 years old, I knew the power of tai chi from books and I was amazed by its philosophy,” said Chow. “So, I decided to take classes, and this is how I started my tai chi journey.”

Chow was fortunate to learn the Chen-style of tai chi – the original form of tai chi – at its birthplace in Henan province, in mainland China. (There are four other traditional styles: Yang, Wu, Wu Hao and Sun; each have different movements and can look very different from one another.) After a few years of observation and training, the Chen family accepted him to be an inheritor, meaning that he could officially teach as a master of Chen-style in Hong Kong.

Mentally, it has taught me how to think and how to control my emotions

Chow enjoys tai chi for both its physical and mental benefits. “Mentally, tai chi is an ancient Chinese method which is a natural and unique way to help relieve stress and soothe our soul,” he said. “Physically, it helps build joint movement in the knees and back, improves balance and fall prevention, adds muscle strength and flexibility and training coordination.” That’s because the movements are usually circular and never forced, the muscles are relaxed rather than tensed, the joints are not fully extended or bent, and connective tissues are not stretched. Chow says he has experienced the health benefits himself.

“When I was a child, I always used to have a fever and coughing,” he said. “But as I grew up and started to practice tai chi, year by year, my health changed, and it has made me very strong now. Mentally, also, it has taught me how to think and how to control my emotions.”

Chow firmly believes that tai chi can be self-healing. “It can help people a lot, especially in a busy city like Hong Kong,” he said. “It can bring peace of mind and soothe the soul. This is very important.”

And as Chow wraps up leading his students through a series of movements in the Tai Chi Garden – among them signature movements like “Buddha pestle” (a punching movement) and “white goose spreading wings” (an advance-and-retreat movement, just like a goose when it opens its wings and jumps very fast suddenly) – it’s certainly soothing to observe. But there’s more to it than one might first assume.

The learning process for Chen-style tai chi is split into 15 levels. Level one involves learning 74 movements as a sequence, which is called a “form”. “When you finish level one, we use the same form (74 movements) in the other 14 levels, but you go deeper and you learn the internal power in the other levels,” said Chow.

Going deeper involves more than just correctly learning the movements, but ensuring that both the external movements and the internal part, the Qi (energy), are moving together as yin and yang. By stimulating the internal energy (Qi) flow it helps to recharge the body and helps to detoxify.

“Tai chi exercise involves the recognition, development, and use of Qi, which refers to the energy in the body,” explained Professor Chan. “Based on theoretical principles that are inherent to traditional Chinese medicine, Qi is the fundamental energy that sustains life and flows in the body along channels called meridians and collaterals, which enhance the integration of all organ systems and tissues, and promote good health and longevity.”

Chow explains how he uses Qi in his own practice. “At the end of each movement in tai chi, we hold the posture until the Qi energy goes down and back to the earth. We call this state ‘Yin’,” said Chow. “Then you can start the next movement and take the Qi from the earth again with breathing to guide the energy to rotate and circulate inside your body. We call this state ‘Yang’. So, the entire sequence of 74 movements contains rhythm and changing of the speed. Alternately yin and yang. This is the meaning of tai chi.”

The meaning of tai chi is something that fellow Hong Kong-based tai chi teacher, Linda Fung, wishes more people better understood.

“We often misunderstand tai chi,” said Fung. “When we say tai chi, people tend to think it’s just moving your arms and legs and doing some movement exercise, but tai chi moves are part of a subset of tai chi philosophy.”

Fung, who practices and teaches the Li-style of tai chi, says that tai chi is more than just the physical movements, it’s a way of life. It encompasses arts, music, lifestyle, she said, and you have to understand the yin and yang that is the core of tai chi.

“In tai chi it’s the interconnection between the yin, which is the body, and yang, which is our mind,” said Fung. “So it’s always the mind and body moving and working together.""

At an 11th-floor yoga studio – a sanctuary of calm overlooking Hong Kong’s dizzying central business district – Fung guides her students through a beginners’ class. Trained as a ballet dancer at the Royal Ballet School in London and later at the Julliard School in New York, she exudes a natural grace that embodies all her movements.

In addition to teaching classes, Fung practices tai chi herself every morning, often outdoors, and says it helps her to achieve a balance in her life.

“In tai chi you slow down your movement, but yet you’re still breathing in certain patterns and so it is movement meditation,” said Fung. “With that level of focus, time just disappears, it’s like there is no time. It’s a great feeling.”

The ability to be able to slow down and to have clarity and awareness even when things are in crisis, is, for Fung, one of the best health benefits of tai chi. “With tai chi practice, even when situations are out of hand, you can still retain a calmness like an eye of the storm. That is the core of tai chi: it’s about harmony.”

And Fung believes that tai chi is a treasure trove of good stuff that has never been more needed in the world. “We have to share it with everyone, particularly now, in the 21st Century, where there are so many ways that we are distracted with problems and even illnesses. Tai chi is really very important for people, to give us a chance for happiness, wisdom and health.”

242,America’s ‘fried chicken war’,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200429-americas-fried-chicken-war,['Diana Lambdin Meyer'],"Located in the heart of the US’ Great Plains, the area around Pittsburg, Kansas, spreads out like one vast prairie. Here, the winds blow bitter cold in winter; the sun parches the soil in summer; and ranchers, farmers and folks from this 20,000-person community gather to watch Friday night football at the local high school. By all accounts, this former coal-mining town is pretty tranquil – that is, until the topic of fried chicken comes up.

Over the past 80 years, this unassuming city has become one of the US’ fried chicken epicentres, and it all started when two women opened chicken joints 300ft apart on the same street – thus creating a local rivalry that still spits and simmers today. Four generations later, their descendants still use their grandmothers’ recipes to continue their legacies, and in many ways, who these women were and how their crispy birds got Pittsburg clucking speaks volumes about the heart and history of America’s Heartland.

The plains surrounding Pittsburg have always been home to large deposits of bituminous coal. These pitch-black rocks were once so abundant that they were found above ground. The Osage Native Americans who once lived here called it “black rocks that make fire”, and they traded it with white settlers.

The first miners arrived in 1866, just one year after the US Civil War ended. Digging deep shafts and breaking apart loads of coal was dangerous, back-breaking work. Soon, notices went out across Europe seeking immigrants to come work in Pittsburg and the surrounding Crawford County. At the height of coal production here in 1914, more than 12,000 miners and their families called Crawford County home, and this rural patch of roughly 55,000 people produced more than one third of the US’ coal.

One of the families who settled in the area was the Rehaks, who sailed over from Austria at the turn of the 20th Century, carrying their infant daughter, Annie. As a teenager, Annie married Charles Pichler. The couple had three children and bought a house in the shadow of the coal mine just outside Pittsburg where Charles worked.

In the middle of Charles’ shift one day in March 1933, the mine whistle blew four times, indicating that there had been an accident. Charles had been hit by a coal cart on the mine tracks. His right leg was amputated on site and his left leg was badly maimed. At the time, there was no such thing as workman’s compensation or disability insurance, and Annie was forced to provide for her family of five in the middle of the US’ Great Depression all alone.

Grandma never talked much about those times, but it had to have been tough

To keep her family from starving, Annie began selling ham and veal sandwiches for a few pennies to miners passing the front of her house. The men ate under the shade of the birch and maple trees outside the Pichlers’ little white house, not far from the outhouses, and drank Annie’s homemade hooch, which she sold for $0.25 for two quarts.

“Grandma never talked much about those times, but it had to have been tough,” said Anthony Pichler, Annie’s grandson. “But Grandma was tough too, and that’s why we’re here today.”

In 1934, looking for a way to grow her business and noting all the free-range chickens in her front yard, Annie started selling fried chicken dinners. She’d wring the birds’ necks, quickly clean and cut them into pieces and fry them on a coal-heated stove in her tiny kitchen. On Saturdays, Annie would move the furniture from the family’s living room and set up a few tables for diners in their tiny home. She also prepared potato salad, coleslaw, pickled peppers and sliced tomatoes from her garden as sides, and rounded the meals out with a slice of white bread. Sometimes, diners would stay and end up dancing until the wee hours of the morning.

One day not long after Annie started her business, a local doctor and fan of Annie’s cooking suggested she name her homespun business “Chicken Annie’s”. The name has stuck like grease on a pan ever since.

Sometimes, diners would stay and end up dancing until the wee hours of the morning

In 1941, a pair of German immigrants, Joe and Mary Zerngast, lived a few doors down from the Pichlers. Joe worked the mines as a “shot-firer”, meaning he was the guy who would go deep inside, light the dynamite and run out – hopefully before it exploded. It was one of the most dangerous jobs in the mines, and after 20 years, “black lung” (coal workers’ pneumoconiosis) cut his career short, leaving Mary to provide for the family.

The Zerngasts also had chickens clucking around in their front yard, a big cast-iron skillet and a coal-fired stove. And like Annie, Mary was a pretty good cook, too. So, just as the Pichlers had done, the Zerngasts cleared out the furniture in their little living room, set up tables and began selling fried chicken dinners with potato salad and coleslaw.

Chicken Annie’s and Chicken Mary’s quickly developed a friendly rivalry, with locals in this tight-knit community having to pick a side

“I needed to survive,” Larry Zerngast, Mary’s grandson, recalled Mary telling the family.

At first, the Zerngasts called their little place, “Joe and Mary’s”. They had a jukebox in the living room and, just like at Annie’s, people often danced until the early morning. If locals under the influence arrived in the middle of the night craving fried chicken, they would often pound on the door, shouting, “Chicken, Mary! Chicken, Mary!”. Mary would open the door, fire up the coal stove and fry chicken until dawn – thus, Chicken Mary’s was born.

The Pichler’s and Zerngast’s little houses soon got so busy with dinners and dancing that the families had to move so they could devote their former homes solely to the restaurant business. Word continued to spread of the families’ mouth-watering, deep-fried birds after World War Two, and poultry pilgrims would drive hours across Kansas to dine at Annie’s or Mary’s – or sometimes, both. As more people flocked to eat at their venues in the 1960s and ‘70s, the ladies tore down their original houses and expanded again, building modern restaurants with commercial kitchens that could seat about 300 instead of 30.

“She always had a smile and would greet her guests by name,” said Donna Lipoglav, Annie’s granddaughter, who recalled that Annie’s waitresses always wore crisp white dresses and aprons. “She was very sweet and gentle, and no, I don’t think she would approve of my sweatshirt today.”

Despite having nearly identical recipes and side dishes, Chicken Annie’s and Chicken Mary’s quickly developed a friendly rivalry, with locals in this tight-knit community having to pick a side and be careful who saw them entering the door of which restaurant.

Lipoglav’s earliest memories are of working in the house with her grandmother, clearing tables and serving guests. Occasionally, Annie would ask her to ride her bike down the street to count the number of cars in Chicken Mary’s parking lot. “I think Grandma was alert as to what was going on,” Lipoglav said. “Our parking lot was always just as full as Mary’s.”

My Grandpa Joe always said, ‘Don’t turn your back on a Pichler, you can’t trust them!

In 1982, the Pichlers tried to rename the small street running in front of both establishments “Chicken Annie’s Road”. When the Zerngasts objected to that, the incident made national headlines with a tongue-in-cheek article in The New Yorker titled, “Fried-Chicken War”.

“My Grandpa Joe always said, ‘Don’t turn your back on a Pichler, you can’t trust them!’,” Donna Zerngast, Mary’s granddaughter, laughed.

Today, Pittsburg’s first families of fried chicken are still at it, with Lipoglav running Chicken Annie’s Original, Larry Zerngast running Chicken Mary’s and Anthony Pichler running Pichler’s Chicken Annie’s alongside an unlikely co-owner: Donna Zerngast, who must not have listened to Grandpa Joe’s advice and has now been married to a Pichler for the last 54 years.

Other than the size of the buildings and the fact that they’re no longer wringing the chickens’ necks themselves, all three businesses still do everything just about the same way Annie and Mary did in the 1930s and ‘40s. Each still batters their birds, then coats them with flour and salt just minutes before frying them in lard. Chicken Mary’s uses egg and milk in the batter; whereas Chicken Annie’s Original and Pichler’s Chicken Annie’s uses just egg.

We have customers who just show up from all across the country because they’ve heard of us and the fried chicken in this part of Kansas

To this Midwesterner, the chicken at both Annie’s and Mary’s has a crisp, light crunch and a tender, juicy inside. But Pittsburg residents know the difference.

“You can put a plate of our chicken next to a plate of their chicken and locals will know which one is which,” said Lana Brooks, who has worked at Chicken Mary’s for 51 years and claims that both families use the same seasonings, just in different amounts. “I think the key to success in both restaurants is that we’re still doing things exactly as Mary and Annie did it. That’s part of the appeal to families who have been coming here their whole life. It’s a part of our community heritage.”

Over the years, Chicken Annie’s and Mary’s have inspired at least nine other homespun fried chicken joints in Crawford County. “We have very loyal customers, but every week, we have customers who just show up from all across the country because they’ve heard of us and the fried chicken in this part of Kansas,” said Missy Pichler, the fourth generation of Pichlers to work at Chicken Annie’s Original and whose teenage daughter also waits tables there.

Every few months, Steve and Melissa Pulis and their boys drive about two hours from Springfield, Missouri, to Pittsburg, eating at Chicken Mary’s on one trip and Chicken Annie’s the next.

“I like Annie’s chicken the best, but Steve likes Mary’s the best,” said Melissa. “But it’s the opposite with the coleslaw. I really like the extra garlic in Mary’s coleslaw. Steve disagrees.”

And that’s the way it goes in Crawford County. Families here are divided in a delicious brawl over fried chicken and the fixins.

Al Eshelbrenner grew up just north of Pittsburg and has been eating fried chicken dinners for nearly 60 years. While he admits that Chicken Mary’s is good, he insists that the difference lies in the seasoning. Today, he maintains his parents’ allegiance and now takes his grandchildren to Chicken Annie’s. “My folks would take us to Chicken Annie’s every Sunday and that’s just what I grew up with,” said Eshelbrenner. “People don’t really argue about it down here because we respect that everyone has their favourites, their family tradition.”

In fact, the Eshelbrenners are so devoted to Chicken Annie’s that they ask the restaurant to cater their family’s Christmas gatherings.

“I think it’s the potato salad and coleslaw that I crave the most,” said Kristian Walker, who was born and raised in Pittsburg but now lives in Harrisburg, PA. Although he no longer has family living in the area, he once drove five hours out of his way just so he could have a fried chicken dinner in Pittsburg.

“I’ve met people from across the country who, as soon as they learn I’m from Pittsburg, start asking me about my favourite fried chicken and telling about the times they’ve been able to eat [it],” he said. “We might not be world famous, but there are sure a lot of people around the world who know about the fried chicken of Crawford County, Kansas.”

243,Bali’s day of quiet reflection,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200430-where-lockdown-is-an-annual-tradition,['Elly Earls'],"It was early afternoon on 25 March in Bali, and for the first time in a long time I could hear myself think. There were no scooters zooming by, no noodle sellers peddling their wares, not even the occasional sound of a plane flying overhead.

In their absence, I noticed the buzz of a dragonfly and a frog’s ribbit as I sat quietly on my porch, trying to get into the spirit of Nyepi – the island’s New Year’s Day, or “Silent Day” – when for 24 hours Balinese people stay quietly in their homes and reflect on the year gone by and gear up for the one to come.

Usually, Balinese New Year’s Day is the calm after the storm. On a typical Balinese New Year’s Eve, the island is a riot of noise and colour. For months, locals have worked on building their neighbourhood’s ogoh-ogoh, a huge effigy made from bamboo and papier-mâché in the shape of a demon. On the big day, the effigies are paraded through the streets in theatrical, boisterous ceremonies.

Also, gamelan bands play while Balinese people practise pengrupukan, which at the household level, is a ceremony that involves brushing a burning bundle of dried coconut leaves against the base of every shrine and building to the accompaniment of noisemaking on bamboo tubes and pot lids while shouting for demons to leave. Over time, the New Year’s Eve ceremony has spilled out from households to public parades with bamboo torches on the streets to rid the whole neighbourhood and town of demons.

Each year, Balinese New Year takes place on a different day as it’s governed by the “Saka” calendar, which is based on the phases of the moon. The Saka dynasty was first founded in 78AD by King Kanishka of India and was said to have been brought to Java by Hindu missionaries and later spread to Bali, which today is the only remaining island in Indonesia with a Hindu majority in a country that’s 90% Muslim.

Celebrations start three days before Nyepi with Melasti, where holy images from temples are taken by procession to the nearest sea, lake, river or spring, where they’re cleansed of any physical or spiritual impurities and people make offerings and pray to their newly purified deities. Two days later, at noon on the eve of Nyepi, tawur agung (pay-offs) of animal sacrifices, raw meat, eggs and liquor are offered to demons along with loud music and noises, which both attract them and then send them away once they’re appeased.

“The practice of getting buta-kala (demons) to leave goes back far in time,” said Garrett Kam, who has been living in South-East Asia for more than 30 years and is the only non-Balinese ritual assistant at Pura Samuan Tiga temple in Bedulu, Gianyar, where he lives. “Every temple ceremony in Bali is preceded by caru (demon-appeasing sacrifices) so that their malevolent desires are satisfied and they become benevolent deities.

Kam continued: “At noon on the eve of Nyepi, such tawur agung or big payoffs occur on a large scale in every village, town, city and district to pay off the demons that accumulate during the year. Every 10 and 100 years, they happen at the island's most important temples to pay off accumulating demons from the decade and century.”

This year, the festivities were heavily scaled back, reminding Kam of his first Nyepi in Bali in the 1980s.

“Ogoh-ogoh were only allowed to be shown around the banjar (local community) that made them and without parades,” he said. “And while some youth groups protested as they had spent thousands of dollars and many weeks on their ogoh-ogoh, most people understood why the parades were banned.”

One thing, though, remained unchanged. While many people across the world are finding the coronavirus lockdown to be a shock to the system, the Balinese are used to it. Every year on Nyepi, the entire island falls silent.

No-one is allowed to leave their homes where they are meant to spend their day with no fire or light (that means no work and no entertainment). Businesses are closed and even the airport shuts down for 24 hours. Some Balinese also fast, turn off their phones and do not speak except in short whispers. Even dogs and roosters are quieter than usual, according to Kam. The local police patrol the streets and beaches to make sure nobody is flouting the rules.

The silence that this time provides is truly the best way to meditate

The reason they do this is because, according to Balinese beliefs, any demons that might return will think the island is deserted and leave it alone for another year. But the Balinese also use this time to reflect on the past year and set goals for the future.

“The silence that this time provides is truly the best way to meditate,” said Sri Darwiati, a Balinese Hindu who was raised in a village in the island’s Tabanan regency and is now school secretary and a board member at Green School Bali. “I have been celebrating and enjoying Nyepi day for more than 40 years, and as I am getting older, I continue to learn the significance behind the ritual.”

She believes spending time at home with your family, even just for a day, can bring joy, and that taking time to reflect can help make us more productive in the future. For Kam, this is all the more important now because the Balinese generally lead very active lives and are rarely at home. “Nyepi allows a full day for them to reconnect with their families without being distracted by TV and internet,” he said.

With social distancing measures now in place in Bali, following one extra day of Nyepi, which was extended this year due to the coronavirus, the benefits associated with “Silent Day” are stretching further. “Fathers are teaching their sons gamelan music and art. My neighbour is learning to play the ukulele on his own. Mothers are teaching their daughters household skills and to help out at their small kiosks and roadside stalls,” Kam said. “This all means a continuing of traditions not learned in classrooms and increased respect for elders who have more roles to fulfil today.”

Nyepi has also been shown to have a positive impact on the environment, even if it is just for 24 hours. A 2015 study by the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics found that total suspended particulate (TSP) concentrations decreased by 73-78% in urban areas on the Balinese Day of Silence, while an analysis by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) saw a 33% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions on Nyepi Day.

As Darwiati said, this is just from one day and one island. “If we were to start a nationwide event, our impact would be much larger. With an event like this not only would we be giving ourselves a break and some room to breathe, we’d also be giving the environment a break from all the carbon we constantly use.”

With half of the global population on coronavirus lockdown, there’s no better time to learn from a culture where slowing down and switching off has been mandated for centuries – if only for a day at a time.

“Prior to Covid-19, Bali was the only airport in the world that would close down, for 24 hours during the Balinese New Year. This is a big move for an island that relies heavily on tourism but shows the great respect for tradition and slowing down that is so ingrained in Balinese culture,” Darwiati said. “The West can learn to honour the simple things in life – connecting with nature, connecting with family, connecting with ourselves – slowing down, switching off and looking at the stars.”

I took her advice. As soon as dusk fell, I went into the garden and gazed up at the inkiest, most star-filled sky I’d ever seen. There was no electric light or fire in sight. As Kam said, “So much has become lost due to light and noise pollution.” When Nyepi was extended for a day this year, I can’t say I was disappointed.

245,Victory gardens: A war-time hobby that’s back in fashion,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200524-victory-gardens-a-war-time-hobby-thats-back-in-fashion,['Ellie Howard'],"It was late March when the UK lockdown was first announced. Around the same time, I ordered a seedling tray and two packets of “Cut ‘n’ Come Again” leafy greens: arugula, rucola, oriental mustard, pak choy and borecole. Nearly two months later, lockdown still hasn’t been lifted, but my tufty lettuce leaves have shot up. For billions, globally, the Covid-19 pandemic has spelt a period of deep uncertainty and stagnation, but watching green miracles occur in my vegetable patch has been reassuring. I’m not alone in thinking so.

The early weeks of the pandemic threw the global supply chain into disarray, setting off a wave of stockpiling. The US saw a spike in alternative milk sales, Australia lacked flour on supermarket shelves, pasta was scarce in Italy and eggs in Britain. Many countries reported fears of labour shortages for perishables such as fresh vegetables, according to Time magazine. As with any crisis, people have been quick to take matters into their own hands – as highlighted by soaring seed sales.

A recent report by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows 42% of Britons have taken to gardening to cope with lockdown, while a third of a million searched for tips on growing garden variety crops on the Royal Horticultural Society website – the most popular being the humble potato. Across the UK and beyond, people are digging in their backyards, potting plants on balconies or using windowsills as suntraps for seedlings.

The rush to grow-your-own has sparked comparisons to ‘victory gardening’. Dug either side of the Atlantic, from North America to Great Britain and further afield in Australia, these kitchen gardens became popularised in World War One and World War Two when shortages reached critical levels in the Allied nations. In response, governments coordinated domestic campaigns calling upon citizens to fuel the war effort and feed the country. Working the soil became a patriotic duty.

In the UK, most widely remembered is the “Dig for Victory” campaign launched by the British Ministry of Agriculture in 1939. It was so successful that the number of allotments grew to 1.7 million in just three years, while private gardens with vegetable produce numbered five million.

Food prices are going up, and fresh produce is going to be at a premium

During the same period, a horticultural magazine paraphrased Napoleon’s claim that the English were a nation of shopkeepers, instead writing: “We might with equal justice be called a nation of gardeners”. The claim stuck. Our obsession with gardening stretches far beyond a national pastime; it is rooted in the British psyche. The garden is considered a private sanctuary but also a site of creative expression and personal pride, as reflected in the highly competitive British annual “giant vegetable” competitions that spring up from Harrogate to Carmarthenshire. For Britons, growing our own produce has the added value of bringing locals together.

Victory gardens were also not just about food: cultivating fruit and vegetables boosted morale and built momentum. Growing for the greater good banded together communities and enabled those stuck at home to play a part, however small. Perhaps this is why the gardens’ legacy can still be felt today. While using the analogy of war to describe a viral pandemic is controversial, it makes sense that we‘ve connected the two moments in time. It is the sense of community spirit we want to revive – and a victory garden quite literally says we are in this together.

Beyond caring for our own families, green-fingered types are sharing produce with their neighbours. A survey commissioned by the British charity RSA cited that 42% of respondents feel the outbreak has made them value food more, and 10% have shared supplies for the first time.

I first noticed the neighbourly potential of plants three weeks after lockdown had begun, when a neighbour I hardly knew knocked on the door of my house in Suffolk. When I answered, she leapt behind the gate: “Alpine strawberries,” she yelled, “Plant them in partial shade”. A week later, a trio of pepper seedlings appeared – another gift. To say thank you, I delivered fat garlicky leaves of wild ransom, foraged between bluebells in a nearby woodland. Now, we swap excited texts about her egg-laying tortoise, Rosie. Since then, I check what Jeanie and her husband, John, would like from the shops; why I waited for a pandemic to do this is beyond me.

Outside their gate, a sign offers willowherb and more wild strawberries – anything surplus they don’t need. “If someone likes something in your garden, you can just take a cutting for them,” John said. “It doesn’t cost you anything.”

The Bristol Seed Swap has been promoting the circular economy of seed saving for years. A few days after lockdown, they advertised leftover seed packets from a previous event, which the public could request free of charge by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope. Diane Holness, a spokesperson for the non-profit, said swells of gardeners were in touch with requests. “We sent seeds to around 150 people,” she said. “I think everyone is aware that food prices are going up, and that fresh produce is going to be at a premium.”

The most requested seeds were tomato; adaptable and easy to grow. “I think they are one crop that can fit into even the tiniest space, even a balcony,” she said.

Luckily, the organisation had plenty. As Holness said, harvesting seeds costs you nothing, but goes a long way to helping someone else: “If you know how, you could almost save enough cabbage seeds for everyone in the city.”

Two hours west of Bristol, West Dorset’s foodie capital, Bridport, has been a hive of activity since lockdown. Created in response to quarantine, the Bridport Grow Your Own community Facebook group has played a large role in greening the town. Just as the 1930s Dig for Victory leaflets relayed growing information, online groups are helping new growers by circulating plant wisdom.

“As a town, I think we are all at it,” environmentalist and educator Kim Squirrel told me. “People have dug up their gardens and others are growing in pots.” She works a private allotment on the town’s edge, shared between 10 houses, that includes her neighbour Rachel Millson. Both have turned their full attention to growing with news of the lockdown. Squirrel’s potager garden is crammed with brassicas alongside beans, French to dwarf, winding up bamboo stalks that are also home-grown. Pear and espalier apple trees will fruit come the summer.

Millson’s garden exploits are equally impressive: overwintering crops such as earthy beetroot, onion and leeks fill up one plot. Another bed is an experiment in perennial vegetables, such as asparagus, that take less carbon from the soil.

“The pandemic has cemented in my mind the need to be growing more food, not just for my own family and to save money, but for the wider community,” Millson said.

She feels fortunate to have an allotment, but wishes there was more recognition that growing your own food isn’t just a pastime but “real, important work”. Millson strongly believes it has personal benefits and also aids community wellbeing. Pre-empting that food inequality is going to be at an all-time high, she has purposefully grown extra vegetable crops with a mind to donate them to a local foodbank.

Part of the fun of growing your own produce is in sharing your hard-earned bounty with family and friends. But while delivering your overzealous courgette crop is practical, there is something special in giving someone a plant they can cultivate themselves.

We have common ground now, something other than the fear around the pandemic

Bruno White had just moved to Ditcheat, Somerset, when the UK went into lockdown on 23 March. He wrote to his new neighbours to introduce himself and set up an informal mutual aid group. One elderly gentleman he shopped for was so grateful that he left a collection of plants on White’s doorstep, each with handwritten instructions. Shortly afterwards, another thankful neighbour gifted him packets of biodynamic seeds: “He taught us about Three Sisters. It's a traditional Native American method. You grow corn, then beans to climb up it, then squash to shade and stifle any weeds.”

White has since been cultivating his garden and has been surprised at how easy it is – and how kind his neighbours are. “We have common ground now, something other than the fear around the pandemic,” he said.

While the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic were filled with panic, hopefully it will be the incredible displays of neighbourly spirit that we will remember. The victory garden movement of the World Wars not only helped strengthen communities, but also gave home-bound individuals a chance to contribute to those fighting on the front line. Amid a pandemic, the vegetable garden has similar appeal: it offers a sustainable solution to food security that not only helps us, but allows us to care for our neighbours too.

At a time of uncertainty and confusion, even planting a lettuce seed can offer a semblance of hope.

250,Spain’s mysterious mummies,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200528-the-guanches-spains-mysterious-mummies,"['Fernando Teixeira', 'Izabela Cardoso']","The Canary Islands’ subtropical climate, aquamarine waters and otherworldly volcanic and desert landscapes led more than 15 million people to visit the archipelago last year. The islands are considered the southernmost region of Spain, with their easternmost point located just 100km west of Morocco. But long before the first Spanish settlers arrived to the islands in the 1470s, another civilisation was already thriving there: the Guanches.

The Guanches’ origins have long been debated and speculated by archaeologists and historians. Some theorise they were descendants of the Celts, or perhaps the Vikings. Others believe they could even be descended from the mythical inhabitants of Atlantis. A 2019 study of the DNA from ancient mummies from the islands, however, revealed they were most likely Berbers from North Africa, who arrived there around 100AD or even earlier.

This media cannot be played on your device.

How exactly the Guanches reached the archipelago remains unclear. One theory suggests they crossed in small vessels, landing in the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. And although the number of settlers also remains a mystery, studies estimate that 14 couples would have been enough to populate the archipelago.

Archaeological studies suggest the Guanches were organised in a tribal society, where chieftains or kings ruled almost absolutely. They relied on farming, hunting and gathering, and their diet included milk, goat, pork and fruits. They mainly dressed in goat-skin leather tunics and vests made of plaited rushes and lived in caves or simple low-stone houses.

They adapted caves and grottoes to be used as silos and temples. Some of those structures have been preserved to this day and indicate the Guanches’ sophisticated astronomical knowledge: holes on the caves’ walls allowed sunlight in at certain positions during different times of the year, marking solstices and equinoxes.

One of the most noteworthy of those structures is Risco Caído, a settlement that consists of 21 caves excavated on a volcanic tuff about 100m high above the Barraco Hondo River in the island of Gran Canaria. The site is believed to have been used as a silo, a temple and a place for astronomical observation, with holes that allowed sunlight and moonlight to enter the caves and illuminate symbolic drawings on the walls. In 2019, Risco Caído became the first Unesco World Heritage site in the Canary Islands.

256,A mysterious US desert civilisation,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200521-a-mysterious-us-desert-civilisation,['Smoke'],"In the heart of the San Juan Basin, in the arid north-western corner of New Mexico, stands one of the greatest ancient treasures in the US: the remarkably preserved remains of a vast building complex believed to have been constructed between 850 and 1250AD that may have housed as many as 5,000 people. The high desert area of Chaco Canyon sees cold winters, scorching-hot summers and only about 22cm of rainfall every year. Yet, it was home to a thriving, yet mysterious, civilisation – the Chacoans, ancestors of the Puebloans.

In 1907, this isolated 53sq-mile expanse of desert became a national historical park, containing 13 major ruins and more than 400 archaeological sites. Pueblo Bonito, the largest excavated site, covers about 2 acres and has roughly 800 rooms arranged in a D-shaped building. The site was designed with sophisticated irrigation systems, the doorways are perfectly aligned with each other to facilitate communication and researchers estimate it housed about 2,000 people.

This media cannot be played on your device.

Today, visitors can wander around the same maze of chambers and roads used by its residents roughly 1,000 years ago. Some of the structures used to create the roofs and different floors are long gone, but their remains clearly reveal how they were built. Approximately 200,000 wooden pillars were used in the construction and were most likely hand-carried from the Chuska Mountains and Mount Taylor, more than 112km away.

The Chacoan roads are another impressive feature of the complex. There are about 650km of them, some 9m wide, built mostly in straight lines that cut through the rough topography instead of going around it. Their positioning, starting at a central structure and running towards notable natural elements, such as lakes and mountains, suggests they represented symbolic connections between man and nature. Yet, it doesn’t mean they weren’t practical: studies have shown that walking on those roads is less tiresome than walking on the rough terrain next to them.

Over the years, archaeologists have come up with different theories for why Chaco was built. Although the place seems to have been a trade hub, the buildings suggest it may also have been an important ceremonial site and point to the Chacoans’ impressive astronomical knowledge. The walls are aligned with the axis of the sunrise on an equinox and the north doorway faces almost exactly true north. Contemporary New Mexico Pueblo tribes, such as the Zuni, still consider Chaco Canyon a sacred site and they return there for ceremonies.

Since 1987, the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, along with other smaller Chaco sites, is a Unesco World Heritage site. For the past few years, one of the biggest threats to the site has been the oil and gas drilling and mining around Chaco Canyon. In 2019, the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act was introduced to the US Senate – if it passes, it will ban those activities within a 16km radius of the site.

262,Riz au lait: A simple French dish made from pantry staples,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200520-rice-pudding-a-simple-french-dish-made-from-pantry-staples,['Emily Monaco'],"Almost the moment that lockdown was announced in France, chefs started posting recipes for French comfort food desserts on Instagram, hoping to spread a bit of sweetness among their fellow citizens. But while crepes, yogurt cake and madeleines all certainly emerged, the recipe to feature most frequently, from the feed of Michelin-starred Stéphanie le Quellec to those of renowned pastry chefs Christophe Michalak and Yann Couvreur, was the humble riz au lait (rice pudding) – a custard-like dessert made by slowly cooking rice with milk and sugar.

A global comfort food While rice pudding exists in various forms around the globe, its very first apparition is hazy: some attribute it to China, while others point to the Indian subcontinent. East Asian iterations include simple sweet congee or the aptly named “eight treasures” steamed pudding, flavoured with a variety of fruits and sweet bean paste. In India, meanwhile, kheer has been enjoyed since ancient times, associated with Hindu god Shiva and with Ayurvedic therapies. Today, nearly every culture around the world has its own version: baked or boiled, spiced or sweetened with fruit. Latin American arroz con leche is often made with condensed milk and spices; in Indonesia, black glutinous rice is the base for bubur ketan hitan. In Scandinavia, tradition even demands that a bowl be left out for mischief-making Christmas elves.

“It’s really a childhood dessert in French culture,” said Marine Gora, co-founder of Gramme restaurant in Paris. “I’d say everyone probably has a childhood memory associated with riz au lait.”

According to culinary historian Patrick Rambourg, riz au lait has long featured on French tables – if not specifically as a comfort food dessert, or even a dessert at all. While riz au lait recipes date as far back as the 14th Century, the concoction, then often made with broth (or almond milk on lean days when the Catholic Church forbade meat and dairy), was usually served to the bedridden or ailing thanks to its nourishing qualities and digestibility. But above all, riz au lait was generally a dish served to the aristocracy.

“Rice was still rare, at that time,” said Rambourg. “Very rare. And so, it was mainly eaten by the rich.”

It was probably because of this association with the upper crust that riz au lait soon took on a sweeter profile, seasoned with saffron and sugar – both of which were rare and expensive, at the time.

By the 16th Century, however, rice began to become more common in France – and in Europe in general – and riz au lait thus started to appear on more modest tables, notably among peasants in the French countryside, albeit only for holiday meals. When beet sugar became popular in France in the 19th Century, thereby making it a more commonplace sweetener even on modest tables, riz au lait slowly but surely became something that those from all walks of life could enjoy, from a simple dessert sweetened only with sugar to more elaborate riz à l’impératrice with candied fruits and alcohol.

The idea of riz au lait being a childhood dessert, then, is one that appeared “very recently,” Rambourg said. As for how exactly that came to be, the waters are murky. Perhaps it comes from the familiarity of its ingredients; perhaps from its digestibility, or the pureness of its white colour, or just from its ease.

But for Rambourg, there’s not one simple answer.

“I think there’s something else behind it… something that isn’t always easy to explain,” he said. “There are recipes that evoke feelings far more than flavour, perhaps.”

While riz au lait is firmly ensconced in the nostalgic, comfort food category of “recettes de grand-mère” (literally, “grandmother’s recipes”), in many French families today, riz au lait is more often eaten out of a store-bought plastic pot than served out of a fancy copper saucepan.

“Often, it’s pretty poorly made,” said Gora. “It’s not creamy, it’s kind of overly compact.”

Some homemade recipes up the ante by folding in whipped cream or egg yolks for richness, while others spice it up with vanilla, cinnamon or caramel. When professional chefs put their hand to the dish, however, it is often to add contemporary textural contrast. Gora’s version calls for caramel-coated puffed rice atop the creamy pudding.

“Whenever you’re building a dish, you always try to look for different textures, so a bit of crunch,” said Gora. “It came to me naturally: the crispy, caramelised rice with a touch of caramel.”

Her recipe is unsurprisingly quite popular among her clients. And while it’s not on her regular menu, patrons make frequent requests for its appearance.

“Whenever anyone asks for it, I always make it the next day!” she said.

Chef Stéphane Jégo, too, opted to include a crunchy caramel topping when he created a version at his 7th-arrondissement Paris restaurant Chez L’Ami Jean 16 years ago. To hear Jégo tell it, he never intended for the riz au lait to remain on the menu quite so long. He was just looking for a nostalgic dessert he could serve that was easy to prepare in advance.

“I wanted something that hearkened back to childhood,” he said, “and to this idea of communal dining.”

His riz au lait has three components: the pudding itself; a creamy caramel made with salted Brittany butter; and house-made nougatine with nuts enrobed in a crunchy caramel coating (see recipe below). Served by the generous bowlful with a wooden spoon, it quickly became the star of Jégo’s menu.

“There’s this regressive side to it, where you get to the end of the meal, and the riz au lait comes, and the first thing everyone says is, ‘Oh, it’s way too much!’,” Jégo said, laughing. “And then it’s just like… oh, one spoon, two spoons, three spoons… and all of a sudden, the bowl is empty.”

Now, Jégo said, he couldn’t take it off the menu, even if he wanted to. “It’s crazy: I get stopped in the street, even abroad, for riz au lait.

“That, to me, is worth all the stars in the world. Because it means you’ve touched people. You’ve got to the heart of what good food can bring to people, and to pleasure, and to memory,” he said.

During confinement, Jégo has prepared 200 litres of riz au lait for hungry Parisians to take away and enjoy at home.

“I don’t really think mine is any better than anyone else’s. It’s the orchestration. The generosity. You’ve got this childlike zeal that just… takes over,” he said, as he stirred the caramel for his most recent batch.

“People just need that comfort.”

Stéphane Jégo’s Riz au Lait Recipe



Rice Pudding

2.5l milk

1 vanilla bean, split

500g short-grain rice

500g sugar

1l cream (Jégo uses Normandy cream)

Heat the milk and the vanilla bean. Add the rice and cook 40 minutes over low heat. When the rice is tender enough to crush between your fingers, add the sugar, and cook 15 minutes more. Remove the vanilla bean and chill the pudding in the fridge.

Whip the cream to medium peaks. Remove the rice from the fridge and use a spoon to break it up and loosen it. Fold in the whipped cream.

Nougatine

250g pistachios

250g walnuts

250g almonds (toasted in the oven with 3 dabs of butter)

125g unsalted butter

190g turbinado sugar

In a saucepan over medium heat, make a light brown caramel with the butter and the sugar. Add the walnuts and the pistachios, and then toss them in the caramel until well coated. Pour everything onto a lined baking sheet containing the toasted almonds, and then set aside to cool.

Salted Caramel

600g heavy cream, plus 25ml for whipping

125g salted butter (Jégo uses Brittany butter)

600g sugar

37g flaky sea salt (Jégo uses fleur de sel)

5½ gelatine sheets, 2g each

In a saucepan over medium heat, make a dark brown caramel with the sugar and the butter. Off the heat, add the cream, sea salt flakes and gelatine. Cook for 30 minutes over low heat. Set aside in the fridge.

Whip the cream to stiff peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into the caramel.

When the nougatine has cooled, break it up into bite-sized pieces. Serve the pudding, caramel and nougatine in serving bowls, so that each diner can assemble his or her own portion.

But above all, riz au lait was generally a dish served to the aristocracy.
The idea of riz au lait being a childhood dessert, then, is one that appeared “very recently,” Rambourg said.

A blue hat was perched on her head and her short tunic, embroidered with pink geometric designs, was tied sharply at the waist. She pointed at a wooden structure made of round logs, raised high above the ground on stilts.

“We caught the bears as cubs and raised them as a member of the family. They shared our food and lived in our village. When the time came, we set one free back into nature and killed the other to eat.”

Having treated the bear well in life, her people believe the spirit of the sacred animal, which they worship as a deity, will ensure the continued good fortune of their community.

Kimiko Naraki is 70 but looks decades younger. She is Ainu, an indigenous people who now live mostly on Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island, but whose lands once spanned from northern Honshu (the Japanese mainland) north to Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands (which are now a disputed part of the Russian Federation). The Ainu have long been of interest to anthropologists because of their cultural, linguistic and physical identity, but most travellers will not have heard of them. That’s because although they were the earliest settlers of Hokkaido, they were oppressed and marginalised by Japanese rule for centuries.

The Ainu have had a difficult history. Their origins are murky, but some scholars believe they are descendants of an indigenous population that once spread across northern Asia. The Ainu called Hokkaido “Ainu Moshiri” (“Land of the Ainu”), and their original occupation was hunting, foraging and fishing, like many indigenous people across the world. They mainly lived along Hokkaido’s warmer southern coast and traded with the Japanese. But after the Meiji Restoration (about 150 years ago), people from mainland Japan started emigrating to Hokkaido as Japan colonised the northernmost island, and discriminatory practices such as the 1899 Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act displaced the Ainu from their traditional lands to the mountainous barren area in the island’s centre.

“It’s a very ugly story,” said Professor Kunihiko Yoshida, law professor at Hokkaido University.

Forced into agriculture, they were no longer able to fish for salmon in their rivers and hunt deer on their land, Yoshida said. They were required to adopt Japanese names, speak the Japanese language and were slowly stripped of their culture and traditions, including their beloved bear ceremony. Due to the wide stigmatisation, many Ainu hid their ancestry. And the long-term effects are clear to see today, with much of the Ainu population remaining poor and politically disenfranchised, with much of their ancestral knowledge lost.

Among other nefarious practices, Japanese researchers ransacked Ainu graves from the late 19th Century to the 1960s, amassing huge collections of Ainu remains for their study and never returning the bones.

Recently, however, things have started to look up for the Ainu. In April 2019, they were legally recognised as an indigenous people of Japan by the Japanese government, after many years of deliberation, which has resulted in a more positive appreciation of Ainu culture and renewed pride in their language and heritage.

""It is important to protect the honour and dignity of the Ainu people and to hand those down to the next generation to realise a vibrant society with diverse values,"" said government spokesman Yoshihide Suga, as reported in The Straits Times.

Naraki continued showing us around the Ainu kotan (village). Still smiling, she pointed to a wooden, cupboard-like structure. “This is the toilet for the men,” she said, giggling. Next to it was a smaller, teepee-style hut. “And this one is for the women.”

I want to tell the world that Japan has indigenous people

Naraki leads tours of this kotan to teach visitors about her culture. It is part of the Sapporo Pirka Kotan (Ainu Culture Promotion Centre), Japan’s first municipal facility featuring indigenous people, where visitors can experience Ainu handicrafts, watch traditional dancing and imagine traditional Ainu life when this area was a vast wilderness and the people lived on and with the land. Located approximately 40 minutes by car from downtown Sapporo, Hokkaido’s capital city, the centre was opened in 2003 to teach both other Japanese and foreign visitors about Ainu culture and spread their message to the world.

“97% of Ainu are underground. But the people who come here to events are very proud of their culture,” said Jeffry Gayman, an educational anthropologist at Hokkaido University who has been working with the Ainu for 15 years.

The pride is especially evident in the centre’s small, well-kept museum, where Ainu artefacts, such as traditional clothing and tools, are carefully displayed. Upstairs are rooms where visitors can join workshops on Ainu embroidery or learn how to make the traditional Ainu musical instrument mukkuri (a bamboo mouth harp). By hosting events, members of the community are able to educate the wider world on their history and situation.

“If I try to tell people about Ainu rights and empowerment, no-one is interested. But when people see our dancing or music, it makes them interested in learning more about us,” explained Ryoko Tahara, an Ainu activist and president of the Ainu Women’s Association.

Although this centre is a significant step in sharing Ainu culture nationally and internationally, no-one lives here. The kotan is a replica to show people what traditional Ainu life was like. Only a few isolated neighbourhood pockets of Ainu people remain, scattered across Hokkaido, with most of the estimated 20,000 Ainu (there are no official figures) assimilated into cities and towns around the island.

However, travellers who look carefully will be able to see traces of their culture everywhere. Many place names in Hokkaido have Ainu origins, such as “Sapporo”, which comes from the Ainu words sat (dry), poro (large) and pet (river) due to its location around the Toyohira River; or “Shiretoko” – a peninsula that sticks out from Hokkaido’s north-eastern tip – which can be translated as “of the ground” (siri) and “protruding point” (etuk).

And Ainu pride is visible at events like the annual Marimo Festival at Lake Akan and the Shakushain festival in Shizunai; and in groups like The Ainu Art Project, a 40-member group that share Ainu culture through their Ainu and rock fusion band and handmade arts and crafts. Restaurants such as Kerapirka in Sapporo serve up traditional Ainu food and act as a hub for the local community.

“And you can see Ainu values in any settings where Ainu people gather, whether that be inside their home, at a local town gathering or an event. But you need to know what you’re looking for,” said Gayman, explaining that “generosity and hospitality” are core Ainu principles. “They’re light-hearted people,” he said.

The Ainu have also become more prominent on the national stage, with activist Kayano Shigeru elected to the Japanese parliament in 1994, where he served five terms; and the hugely popular manga series, Golden Kamuy, pushing Ainu culture into the national spotlight over the last couple of years.

“In the last few years, people have become more interested in the Ainu; it has become a hot topic in Japan,” said Tahara. “That makes me proud that people will know about the Ainu, but there is still work to be done.”

The latest step forward for this community is the Symbolic Space for Ethnic Harmony in Shiraoi, Hokkaido, a new complex currently under construction by the government to showcase Ainu culture. Made up of a National Ainu Museum, the National Park for Ethnic Harmony and a memorial facility, it was scheduled to open in April 2020 in time for the Olympics, but has been delayed due to Covid-19.

The recognition is very symbolic, but not so meaningful

However, many experts believe that the recent recognition of the community is not enough, saying it is merely lip-service by the government, with the new Ainu bill failing to provide Japan’s indigenous people with clear and strong rights.

“The Ainu still cannot fish their salmon and dams are still being built that submerge sacred sites,” said Yoshida. “There’s no self-determination, no collective rights and no reparations. It’s just a cultural performance.”

“The recognition is very symbolic, but not so meaningful,” he added with a sad laugh, noting that Japan is far behind the world standard in treatment of indigenous people. “It’s a shameful situation. That’s the reality.”

As I followed Naraki on her tour of the kotan, it seemed clear, however, that public interest in Ainu culture is strong. Groups of Japanese people and other visitors, who’d arrived by bus-load from Sapporo, jostled for pictures in front of the pu, the hut for storing food, which is located directly opposite the poro-ci-set, where the village chiefs lived in order to keep a stern eye on the village’s communal larder. “The elders would resolve any disputes in the village,” Naraki said. If no one could agree, they would discuss for three days and three nights and then make a decision.

She explained how the Ainu’s lives were tied to the land. Kotans would be constructed along rivers or by the sea where water was plentiful and safe from natural disasters. Food was foraged or hunted, with staple proteins including salmon, deer and bear. They would pick wild grasses, vegetables, mushrooms and berries, such as kitopiro (Alpine leek) and shikerepe (berries of the Amur cork tree), never picking everything at once and always leaving the roots so the plants could keep growing. Food was simple, with animal oil, kelp and salt the only flavourings, and millet their main grain. Clothes were made with animal or fish skin, or woven with tree bark or nettle fibres.

Living in harmony with nature is a way of life that many Ainu would like to return to. “Eventually what I want is to get back some land so we can hunt and fish freely as well as do our traditional farming,” Tahara told me. Increasing numbers of Ainu are also starting to relearn their language, which is linguistically isolated and declared as critically endangered by Unesco.

What are your other hopes for the future, I asked Tahara.

“I want to tell the world that Japan has indigenous people. People don’t know,” she said. “I want us all to respect each other, to treat each other respectfully and live peacefully in this country. And, of course, I would like our ancestors’ bones returned. Bring them back to the graves they were taken from.”

273,The secret to a long and healthy life? Eat less,https://bbc.com/future/article/20170601-the-secret-to-a-long-and-healthy-life-eat-less,['Alex Riley'],"Eating less certainly seemed to help the monkeys, but calorie restriction is much tougher for people out in the real world. For one, our access to regular, high-calorie meals is now easier than ever; with companies like Deliveroo and UberEats, there is no longer a need to walk to the restaurant anymore. And two, gaining weight simply comes more naturally to some people.

“There’s a huge genetic component to all of this and its much harder work for some people than it is for others to stay trim,” says Anderson. “We all know someone who can eat an entire cake and nothing happens, they look the exact same. And then someone else walks past a table with a cake on it and they have to go up a pant size.”

Ideally, the amount and types of food we eat should be tailored to who we are – our genetic predisposition to gaining weight, how we metabolise sugars, how we store fat, and other physiological fluxes that are beyond the scope of scientific instruction at the moment, and perhaps forever.

But a predisposition to obesity can be used as a guide to life choices rather than an inevitability. “I personally have a genetic history of obesity running through my family, and I practice a flexible form of caloric restriction,” says Susan Roberts a dietary scientist at Tufts University in Boston. “I keep my BMI at 22, and [have calculated] that that requires eating 80% of what I would eat if my BMI was at 30 like every other member of my family.” Roberts stresses that it isn’t hard – she follows her own weight management programme using a tool called iDiet to help her eat less but avoid feeling hungry or deprived of enjoyment. If this wasn’t possible, she adds, she wouldn’t practise calorie restriction.

Not only has Roberts seen the problems of obesity first-hand in her family, she knows the benefits of CR better than most. For over 10 years she has been a leading scientist in the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy trial, also known as Calerie. Over two years, 218 healthy men and women aged between 21 and 50 years were split into two groups. In one, people were allowed to eat as they normally would (ad libitum), while the other ate 25% less (CR). Both had health checks every six months.

Unlike in the Rhesus monkey trials, tests over two years can’t determine whether CR reduces or delays age-related diseases. There simply isn’t enough time for their development. But the Calerie trials tested for the next best thing: the early biological signs of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.

Published in 2015, the results after two years were very positive. In the blood of calorie-restricted people, the ratio of “good” cholesterol to “bad” cholesterol had increased, molecules associated with tumour formation – called tumour necrosis factors (TNFs) – were reduced by around 25%, and levels of insulin resistance, a sure sign of diabetes, fell by nearly 40% compared to people who ate their normal diets. Overall, the blood’s pressure was lower.","And two, gaining weight simply comes more naturally to some people.

“There’s a huge genetic component to all of this and its much harder work for some people than it is for others to stay trim,” says Anderson. “We all know someone who can eat an entire cake and nothing happens, they look the exact same. And then someone else walks past a table with a cake on it and they have to go up a pant size.”

Ideally, the amount and types of food we eat should be tailored to who we are – our genetic predisposition to gaining weight, how we metabolise sugars, how we store fat, and other physiological fluxes that are beyond the scope of scientific instruction at the moment, and perhaps forever.

But a predisposition to obesity can be used as a guide to life choices rather than an inevitability. “I personally have a genetic history of obesity running through my family, and I practice a flexible form of caloric restriction,” says Susan Roberts a dietary scientist at Tufts University in Boston. “I keep my BMI at 22, and [have calculated] that that requires eating 80% of what I would eat if my BMI was at 30 like every other member of my family.” Roberts stresses that it isn’t hard – she follows her own weight management programme using a tool called iDiet to help her eat less but avoid feeling hungry or deprived of enjoyment. If this wasn’t possible, she adds, she wouldn’t practise calorie restriction.

Not only has Roberts seen the problems of obesity first-hand in her family, she knows the benefits of CR better than most. For over 10 years she has been a leading scientist in the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy trial, also known as Calerie. Over two years, 218 healthy men and women aged between 21 and 50 years were split into two groups. In one, people were allowed to eat as they normally would (ad libitum), while the other ate 25% less (CR). Both had health checks every six months.

Unlike in the Rhesus monkey trials, tests over two years can’t determine whether CR reduces or delays age-related diseases. There simply isn’t enough time for their development. But the Calerie trials tested for the next best thing: the early biological signs of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.

Published in 2015, the results after two years were very positive. In the blood of calorie-restricted people, the ratio of “good” cholesterol to “bad” cholesterol had increased, molecules associated with tumour formation – called tumour necrosis factors (TNFs) – were reduced by around 25%, and levels of insulin resistance, a sure sign of diabetes, fell by nearly 40% compared to people who ate their normal diets. Overall, the blood’s pressure was lower.","And two, gaining weight simply comes more naturally to some people.

Across the city, swathes of eminent men were succumbing to sickness, and practically all of them were dying. The losses were as baffling as they were alarming.

Then one day, a slave approached a curule aedile – a kind of magistrate – and hinted that she might know why. The girl led a team of investigators to various houses, where she claimed they would find an alliance of upper-class women secretly preparing poisons. They did.

The accused were dragged to the central square, and asked to prove their innocence. Since they claimed their concoctions were medicinal, would they drink them?

Alas, two of the suspects obliged – and promptly dropped dead. Mass arrests followed, and a further 170 women were found to be involved. The incident was a huge scandal. In the aftermath, the people of Rome elected a dedicated official to perform a ritual banishment of evil, a tactic which had previously only been used as a last resort after extreme civil unrest.

Or, at least, this is the version of events that was dutifully recorded by the respected historian Livy, who was born a few hundred years later. But he wasn’t convinced that the women were really responsible, and neither are modern-day experts. Instead, Livy pointed to a far more rational explanation: an epidemic.

At the time, the city was in the grip of an unknown plague – a common cause of death in the classical world. Mass poisonings, on the other hand, were unheard of. The case discussed by Livy was the first of its kind, and the whole affair had struck Roman citizens as distinctly odd.

In fact, the women probably really were preparing medicines – and the rest of the story was heavily embellished or entirely made up. The infamous poisonings of 331 BC are thought to be a conspiracy theory, to explain deaths that had an obvious cause all along.

291,How staying indoors affects your immune system,https://bbc.com/future/article/20200521-can-staying-inside-weaken-the-immune-system,['Linda Geddes'],"For the past two months, a sizable chunk of the world’s population has been shuttered inside their homes, only stepping out for essential supplies. Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.

Humans evolved on a planet with a 24-hour cycle of light and dark, and our bodies are set up to work in partnership with sunlight. One of the most obvious examples of this is the production of vitamin D in the skin in response to UVB exposure. This daily dose of vitamin D can help to strengthen our bones and teeth, but it also has an effect on our immune cells.

Vitamin D enables the macrophages in our lungs – a first line of defence against respiratory infections – to spew out an antimicrobial peptide called cathelicidin, killing bacteria and viruses directly. It also tweaks the activity of other immune cells, such as B and T cells, which orchestrate longer-term responses. People with low levels of vitamin D are at greater risk of viral respiratory tract infections such as influenza.

Researchers are now investigating whether vitamin D supplements could even reduce the risk of some of the severe complications associated with Covid-19. Earlier this month, Rose Kenny, a gerontologist at Trinity College Dublin, and her colleagues published data suggesting that European populations with the highest death rates from Covid-19, including Spain and Italy, have the lowest levels of vitamin D. This may sound counterintuitive, given their sunny climates, but it is thought that changes in lifestyle have led people to spend more time indoors, which combined with greater use of sunscreen in these countries, may be responsible for the lower levels of vitamin D.","Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.

Vitamin D enables the macrophages in our lungs – a first line of defence against respiratory infections – to spew out an antimicrobial peptide called cathelicidin, killing bacteria and viruses directly.
People with low levels of vitamin D are at greater risk of viral respiratory tract infections such as influenza.","['risk', 'vitamin', 'levels', 'system', 'staying', 'obvious', 'infections', 'affects', 'immune', 'indoors', 'd', 'effect', 'greater', 'respiratory']"

293,How staying indoors affects your immune system,https://bbc.com/future/article/20200521-can-staying-inside-weaken-the-immune-system,['Linda Geddes'],"For the past two months, a sizable chunk of the world’s population has been shuttered inside their homes, only stepping out for essential supplies. Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.

Humans evolved on a planet with a 24-hour cycle of light and dark, and our bodies are set up to work in partnership with sunlight. One of the most obvious examples of this is the production of vitamin D in the skin in response to UVB exposure. This daily dose of vitamin D can help to strengthen our bones and teeth, but it also has an effect on our immune cells.

Vitamin D enables the macrophages in our lungs – a first line of defence against respiratory infections – to spew out an antimicrobial peptide called cathelicidin, killing bacteria and viruses directly. It also tweaks the activity of other immune cells, such as B and T cells, which orchestrate longer-term responses. People with low levels of vitamin D are at greater risk of viral respiratory tract infections such as influenza.

Researchers are now investigating whether vitamin D supplements could even reduce the risk of some of the severe complications associated with Covid-19. Earlier this month, Rose Kenny, a gerontologist at Trinity College Dublin, and her colleagues published data suggesting that European populations with the highest death rates from Covid-19, including Spain and Italy, have the lowest levels of vitamin D. This may sound counterintuitive, given their sunny climates, but it is thought that changes in lifestyle have led people to spend more time indoors, which combined with greater use of sunscreen in these countries, may be responsible for the lower levels of vitamin D.","Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.

64,George Floyd death: Violence erupts on sixth day of protests,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52872401,[],"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Protesters run as police use flash grenades to disperse crowds in Washington, DC

Violence has erupted in cities across the US on the sixth night of protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd.

Curfews have been imposed in nearly 40 cities, but people have largely ignored them, leading to tense stand-offs.

Riot police clashed with protesters in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, firing tear gas and pepper bullets to try to disperse the crowds.

Police vehicles were set on fire and shops were looted in several cities.

The National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - said on Sunday that 5,000 of its personnel had been activated in 15 states and Washington, DC, where crowds once again gathered near the White House, this time lighting fires and throwing stones at riot officers.

""State and local law enforcement agencies remain responsible for security,"" the National Guard added.

It has emerged that in Friday night's unrest, President Donald Trump was briefly taken by the secret service into an underground bunker at the White House, for his safety.

The US is witnessing the most widespread racial turbulence and civil unrest since the violent backlash to the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968, says the BBC's Nick Bryant.

More than 75 cities have seen protests, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus, thronged with demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder.

The Floyd case has reignited anger over police killings of black Americans. For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died.

What's the latest on the protests?

There were many instances of police vehicles being vandalised and set alight on Sunday. Riot officers continued to respond with tear gas and flash grenades.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Stores were looted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

In Philadelphia, local TV stations showed people smashing police cars and looting at least one store.

Mr Trump tweeted: ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard.""

Looting was also reported in Santa Monica, California.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Protesters reportedly threw bottles at riot officers in Boston before torching a police cruiser

In Minneapolis, a lorry driver was arrested after reportedly breaching a road barrier before speeding towards a crowd of protesters marching along a major motorway.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption A tanker drives towards a crowd of protesters marching on a highway in Minneapolis, Minnesota

Footage posted on social media showed dozens of people surrounding the vehicle and pulling the driver out from behind the wheel after it came to a stop.

The driver was later taken to hospital with minor injuries. There were no immediate reports of other casualties.

Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said the motive of the driver was unclear, adding: ""To not have tragedy and many deaths is simply an amazing thing.""

In Denver, thousands of people protested peacefully in Colorado State Capitol by lying face down with their hands behind their backs and chanting: ""I can't breathe"" - a reference to the circumstances of Mr Floyd's death.

Large-scale protests also took place in Atlanta, Boston, Miami and Oklahoma City.

There were also several reported incidents of riot police responding disproportionately to the demonstrators. In Atlanta, Georgia, two officers were sacked on Sunday for using excessive force - including firing a taser - on two young college students.

A white ex-policeman has been charged with murdering Mr Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis.

Derek Chauvin, 44, is due to appear in court later on Monday.

It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement.

For three years, Donald Trump presided over a nation of relative peace and prosperity. The crises he faced were largely of his own making, and he confronted them by rallying his supporters and condemning his opponents.

Now Trump faces a situation ill-suited to a playbook of division. The US economy has been hobbled by a deadly pandemic. George Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has spread racial unrest across the nation. The public is uncertain and afraid - and increasingly angry.

These are circumstances that would test the abilities of even the most skilful leaders. This president, however, risks becoming lost at sea. His public calls for unity and healing have been undermined by a penchant for Twitter name-calling and bellicosity. Message discipline, a valuable attribute at this moment, is not his forte.

There may be no easy way to guide the nation through its current peril. Barack Obama's measured coolness did nothing to stop the fires of Ferguson any more than Richard Nixon's law-and-order edicts quelled Vietnam-era unrest.

The economic and social devastation of the pandemic has created a political landscape of dry brush ignited by the lightning strike of Floyd's death. The president may not be able to contain the wildfire, even if he isn't feeding the flames.

What happened to George Floyd?

On the evening of Monday 25 May, police received a phone call from a neighbourhood grocery store alleging that George Floyd had paid with a counterfeit $20 note.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A memorial to George Floyd near the spot where he died while in police custody in Minneapolis

Officers were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic.

According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started.

With Mr Chauvin's knee on his neck, Mr Floyd can be heard saying ""please, I can't breathe"" and ""don't kill me"".

According to a preliminary autopsy by the county medical examiner, the police officer had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive.

Nearly two minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead around an hour later.

A lawyer for Mr Floyd's family has accused Mr Chauvin of ""premeditated murder"".","For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died.

Riot police clashed with protesters in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, firing tear gas and pepper bullets to try to disperse the crowds.

Police vehicles were set on fire and shops were looted in several cities.

The National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - said on Sunday that 5,000 of its personnel had been activated in 15 states and Washington, DC, where crowds once again gathered near the White House, this time lighting fires and throwing stones at riot officers.

""State and local law enforcement agencies remain responsible for security,"" the National Guard added.

It has emerged that in Friday night's unrest, President Donald Trump was briefly taken by the secret service into an underground bunker at the White House, for his safety.

The US is witnessing the most widespread racial turbulence and civil unrest since the violent backlash to the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968, says the BBC's Nick Bryant.

More than 75 cities have seen protests, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus, thronged with demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder.

The Floyd case has reignited anger over police killings of black Americans. For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died.

What's the latest on the protests?

There were many instances of police vehicles being vandalised and set alight on Sunday. Riot officers continued to respond with tear gas and flash grenades.

In Philadelphia, local TV stations showed people smashing police cars and looting at least one store.

Mr Trump tweeted: ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard.""

Looting was also reported in Santa Monica, California.

Footage posted on social media showed dozens of people surrounding the vehicle and pulling the driver out from behind the wheel after it came to a stop.

The driver was later taken to hospital with minor injuries. There were no immediate reports of other casualties.

Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said the motive of the driver was unclear, adding: ""To not have tragedy and many deaths is simply an amazing thing.""

In Denver, thousands of people protested peacefully in Colorado State Capitol by lying face down with their hands behind their backs and chanting: ""I can't breathe"" - a reference to the circumstances of Mr Floyd's death.

Large-scale protests also took place in Atlanta, Boston, Miami and Oklahoma City.

There were also several reported incidents of riot police responding disproportionately to the demonstrators. In Atlanta, Georgia, two officers were sacked on Sunday for using excessive force - including firing a taser - on two young college students.

A white ex-policeman has been charged with murdering Mr Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis.

Derek Chauvin, 44, is due to appear in court later on Monday.

It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement.

For three years, Donald Trump presided over a nation of relative peace and prosperity. The crises he faced were largely of his own making, and he confronted them by rallying his supporters and condemning his opponents.

Now Trump faces a situation ill-suited to a playbook of division. The US economy has been hobbled by a deadly pandemic. George Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has spread racial unrest across the nation. The public is uncertain and afraid - and increasingly angry.

These are circumstances that would test the abilities of even the most skilful leaders. This president, however, risks becoming lost at sea. His public calls for unity and healing have been undermined by a penchant for Twitter name-calling and bellicosity. Message discipline, a valuable attribute at this moment, is not his forte.

There may be no easy way to guide the nation through its current peril. Barack Obama's measured coolness did nothing to stop the fires of Ferguson any more than Richard Nixon's law-and-order edicts quelled Vietnam-era unrest.

The economic and social devastation of the pandemic has created a political landscape of dry brush ignited by the lightning strike of Floyd's death. The president may not be able to contain the wildfire, even if he isn't feeding the flames.

What happened to George Floyd?

On the evening of Monday 25 May, police received a phone call from a neighbourhood grocery store alleging that George Floyd had paid with a counterfeit $20 note.

Officers were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic.

According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started.

With Mr Chauvin's knee on his neck, Mr Floyd can be heard saying ""please, I can't breathe"" and ""don't kill me"".

According to a preliminary autopsy by the county medical examiner, the police officer had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive.

Nearly two minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead around an hour later.

A lawyer for Mr Floyd's family has accused Mr Chauvin of ""premeditated murder"".","For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died.

Curfews have been imposed in multiple cities in the US, after unrest and protests have spread across the country over the death of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody.

Most of the protests began peacefully - and several stayed peaceful. But in a large number of cases, demonstrators clashed with police, set police cars on fire, vandalised property or looted shops. The National Guard has activated 5,000 of its personnel across 15 states and Washington DC.

Experts have also drawn parallels with the 2011 England riots - when a peaceful protest over a man who was shot dead by police turned into four days of riots, with widespread looting and buildings set alight.

How do protests spread so quickly - and why do some become violent?

Protests spread when there's a shared identity

Image copyright AFP Image caption Many of the daytime protests were peaceful

Incidents like Mr Floyd's death can ""become a trigger moment because it symbolises a broader experience, amongst much larger numbers of people, about the relationship between police and the black community"", says Prof Clifford Stott, an expert in crowd behaviour and public order policing at Keele University.

Confrontations are particularly likely when there are structural inequalities, he adds.

Prof Stott studied the 2011 England riots extensively, and found that the riots there spread because protesters in different cities identified with each other - either because of their ethnicity, or because they shared a dislike of the police.

This meant that, when the police appeared to be overwhelmed, rioters in different districts felt empowered to mobilise.

How the police respond matters

Violent protests are less likely when police have a good relationship with the local community - but how they react to demonstrations on the day also matters, experts say.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Protesters squared off against police in Los Angeles on Saturday

""Riots are a product of interactions - largely to do with the nature of the way police treats crowds,"" says Prof Stott.

For example, he says, in a large crowd of protesters, tensions may begin with just a few people confronting the police.

However, ""police often react towards the crowd as a whole"" - and if people feel that the police use of force against them is unjustified, this increases their ""us versus them"" mentality.

This ""can change the way people feel about violence and confrontation - for example, they may start feeling that violence is legitimate given the circumstances.""

Darnell Hunt, dean of social sciences at UCLA, believes police in the US ""ramped up their aggressiveness"" over the weekend.

""Deploying the national guard, using rubber bullets, tear gas, and pepper spray - these are a range of police tactics that can exacerbate an already-tense situation.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Minneapolis voices: ‘As a black American I am terrified’

It's a pattern that has been seen in other protests around the world too. For example, in 2019, Hong Kong saw seven months of anti-government protests, that began as mostly peaceful and ended up increasingly violent.

Experts highlight a series of police tactics that were seen as heavy-handed - including the firing of large amounts of tear gas at young protesters - as moves that galvanised protesters and made them more confrontational.

Prof Stott argues that police forces that have invested in de-escalation training are more likely to avoid violence at protests. He points to protests that were able to stay peaceful in the US over the weekend - such as in Camden, New Jersey, where officers joined the residents in a march against racism.

It also depends on what's at stake

Moral psychology can help explain why some protests turn violent, says Marloon Moojiman, an assistant professor in organisational behaviour at Rice University.

A person's sense of morality is central to how they see themselves, so ""when we see something as immoral, it creates strong feelings, because we feel our understanding of morality has to be protected"".

""This can override other concerns people have about keeping peace"", because ""if you think the system is broken, you're going to want to really do something drastic to show that that's not acceptable.""

This can apply to a wide range of beliefs - for example, in an extreme case, someone who thinks abortion is a moral outrage may be more likely to say it's OK to bomb an abortion clinic, he says.

Research suggests that social media echo chambers could also make people more susceptible to endorsing violence, if they believe that their peers have the same moral views as them, he adds.

Looting and vandalism can be more targeted than you think

In the US, hundreds of businesses have been damaged, and there has been widespread looting in LA and Minneapolis over the weekend.

However, Prof Stott warns that while it's easy to assume that riots and crowds are ""irrational and chaotic, none of that is true - it's highly structured and meaningful for the people taking part"".

""To some extent, looting is an expression of power - black citizens may have felt disempowered in relation to the police - but in the context of a riot, the rioters momentarily become more powerful than the police.""

Studies of previous riots show that places that get looted are often related to big businesses, and that looting ""often relates to the sense of inequality related to living in capitalistic economies"", he says.

Image copyright AFP Image caption An Apple Store in Los Angeles was among those looted

Prof Hunt has studied the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which were sparked after four white police officers were acquitted over the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King.

He says there is ""a long history of targeting, or selectivity"", in vandalism and looting. ""In the LA uprisings, you'd often see 'minority owned' spray painted on minority businesses, so that people would bypass those.""

However, both Prof Stott and Prof Hunt caution that looting is complicated - especially as lots of people with different motivations take part, including people in poverty, or organised criminals.

The idea that violent protests are targeted and meaningful events to those taking part can also explain why looting occurs in some protests, but not others.

In Hong Kong for example, protesters smashed shop windows, threw petrol bombs at police, and defaced the national emblem - but there was no looting.

Lawrence Ho, a specialist in policing and public order management at the Education University of Hong Kong, believes this is because those protests were triggered by political developments and anger at the police, rather than discrimination and social inequality.

""Vandalism was targeted at stores seen to have a strong connection to mainland China,"" says Dr Ho. ""It was a deliberate attempt to convey a message.""

How can violence be prevented?

Public order experts say that for the police, being seen as legitimate and able to engage protesters in dialogue is key.

""Good policing tries to avoid an 'us' and 'them' mentality, and also tries to avoid the sense that police can act in ways that people see as illegitimate,"" says Prof Stott.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police cars, including in New York, were set on fire

Dr Ho also believes that negotiation is the best way - but points out that ""one of the hardest things today is that a lot of protests are leaderless. If you can't find the leader, you can't negotiate with them.""

More generally, he adds, politicians can make matters better - or worse - based on their approach to dialogue, and whether they use emergency legislation.

Ultimately, however, riots can be a symptom of deep-seated tensions and complicated issues that don't have an easy solution.

Prof Hunt says this week's US riots are the most serious ones since 1968 - after Martin Luther King was assassinated.

""You can't think about police brutality, and the profiling of certain communities, without thinking about the inequalities that exist in society and fuel those concerns,"" he says.

The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.

George Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Footage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor.

Mr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.

The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far.

It began with a report of a fake $20 (£16.20) bill.

A report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.

Believing the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police.

Mr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC.

But Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.

In a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but ""he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that"", according to a transcript released by authorities.

The employee said the man appeared ""drunk"" and ""not in control of himself"", the transcript says.

Shortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.

After approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.

Mr Lane, prosecutors said, ""put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car"". Then Mr Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed"".

Once handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for ""passing counterfeit currency"".

It was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued.

At around 20:14, Mr Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic"", according to the report.

Mr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.

During this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd out of the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said.

He lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.

That's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last.

Mr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.

""I can't breathe,"" Mr Floyd said repeatedly, pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"".

For eight minutes and 46 seconds, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors' report says.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Derek Chauvin is due to appear in court in Minneapolis on Monday

About six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.

One of the other officers, JA Kueng, did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but ""couldn't find one"". Yet, the officers did not move.

At 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance.

He was pronounced dead around an hour later.

On the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.

Forgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.

""The way he died was senseless,"" Harris said. ""He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.""","The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes.

US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have docked with, and entered, the International Space Station (ISS).

Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - attached to the bow section of the orbiting lab 422km above China.

After a wait for leak, pressure and temperature checks, the pair disembarked to join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS.

Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday.

Theirs is the first crew outing launched from American soil since the retirement of the US space agency (Nasa) shuttles nine years ago.

The mission marks the beginning of a new era in which Nasa will be purchasing transport services from the commercial sector. No more will it own and operate the American vehicles that run to and from the station.

This will be done exclusively by firms such as SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST) on Sunday, 19 hours after leaving the Kennedy Space Center atop a Falcon rocket also provided by SpaceX.

The docking was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach.

The doors between Dragon and the ISS were opened at 17:02 GMT (18:02 BST). When Hurley and Behnken floated through, they were met by ISS Commander and fellow Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.

""We're just happy to be here and Chris is going to put us work. And hopefully we will fit in and not mess too many things up,"" said Doug Hurley as he nursed a bruise picked up on his forehead.

Bob Behnken said the pair were well rested and ready for the tasks ahead.

""We did get probably a good seven hours or so (of sleep),"" he said in a radio link with mission control in Houston, Texas. ""The first night is always a little bit of a challenge, but the Dragon was a slick vehicle, and we had good air flow and so we had an excellent evening. (We're) just excited to be back in low-Earth orbit again.""

Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine congratulated the duo on a job well done: ""The whole world saw this mission and we are so, so proud of everything you've done for our country and, in fact, to inspire the world.""

SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans.

Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers.

SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract, which will encompass six astronaut ""taxi"" flights, with the first of these likely to occur at the end of August.

Hurley's and Behnken's arrival at the ISS means they get to claim a Stars and Stripes flag placed on the platform by the members of the very last space shuttle mission in 2011.

The Atlantis orbiter's crew left this flag as an incentive to all those that came after them. The flag, which also flew on the very first shuttle flight in 1981, will now be returned to Earth to be given to the mission that next goes beyond Earth orbit.

Earlier, Hurley and Behnken named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it ""Endeavour"", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s.

It's somewhat uncertain how long Hurley and Behnken will stay at the ISS, but perhaps as much as four months.

In that time, they will become members of the current ISS Expedition 63 crew, taking part in the platform's everyday science and maintenance activities.

Chris Cassidy joked that because his new crewmates arrived on a Sunday, they had missed the cleaning chores that normally take place on a Saturday. ""We'll catch up next weekend,"" the commander said.

Seven former UK foreign secretaries have urged Boris Johnson to form a global alliance to coordinate the response to the China-Hong Kong crisis.

China is facing mounting criticism over a planned security law for Hong Kong which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would not turn a blind eye.

Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997 but under a unique agreement.

The former British colony enjoys some freedoms not seen in mainland China - and these are set out in a mini-constitution called the Basic Law.

But there are fears the proposed law, which has sparked a mass of anti-mainland protests in Hong Kong, could compromise some of the freedoms guaranteed by the Basic Law.

In their letter to the prime minister, the cross-party group of former cabinet ministers says the UK government must be seen to lead the international response, as many countries take their cue from Britain over its former colony.

Jeremy Hunt, David Miliband, Jack Straw, William Hague, Malcolm Rifkind, David Owen and Margaret Beckett all expressed their concern at what they call China's ""flagrant breach"" of Sino-British agreements by imposing tough national security laws on Hong Kong.

They urged Mr Johnson to set up an ""international contact group"" of allies to coordinate any joint action, similar to that set up in 1994 to try to end the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.

A Downing Street spokesman insisted the government was already playing a leading role with international partners in urging China to think again.

Mr Raab said the new security legislation ""very clearly violates"" the autonomy that is guaranteed under Chinese law as well as that in the 1997 agreement.

He confirmed the UK will allow those who hold British National (Overseas) passports to come to the UK and apply to study and work for an extendable 12-month period.

This will in turn ""provide a path to citizenship"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.

Mr Raab said up to three million people registered as a British national (overseas) in Hong Kong could be eligible for UK citizenship if China presses ahead with the law.

Meanwhile, the chairman of Commons foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, said the government must realise that China has a ""very, very authoritarian system of government"" and should rethink the partnership between the two.","Image copyright AFP Image caption Beijing's proposed security law has sparked protests in Hong KongSeven former UK foreign secretaries have urged Boris Johnson to form a global alliance to coordinate the response to the China-Hong Kong crisis.

Mining giant Rio Tinto has apologised for blowing up 46,000-year-old Aboriginal caves in Western Australia dating back to the last Ice Age.

The Juukan Gorge caves, in the Pilbara region, were destroyed last Sunday as Rio Tinto expanded an iron ore project agreed with the authorities.

Many prehistoric artefacts have been found at the remote heritage site.

""We are sorry for the distress we have caused,"" said Chris Salisbury, the firm's iron ore chief executive.

""We pay our respects to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura People (PKKP),"" he said. The PKKP are the traditional owners of the site.

""We will continue to work with the PKKP to learn from what has taken place and strengthen our partnership. As a matter of urgency, we are reviewing the plans of all other sites in the Juukan Gorge area.""

Artefacts found there include a belt made from human hair, analysis of which showed a direct link going back 4,000 years between the PKKP and the prehistoric cave-dwellers.

'Devastating blow'

""Today we also recognise that a review is needed in relation to the management of heritage in Western Australia more broadly,"" Mr Salisbury said.

Besides iron ore, the Anglo-Australian giant has many mining interests in Australia, including bauxite for aluminium, diamonds and uranium.

Last week a PKKP representative, John Ashburton, said losing the site was a ""devastating blow"".

""There are less than a handful of known Aboriginal sites in Australia that are as old as this one... its importance cannot be underestimated,"" Reuters news agency quoted him as saying.

""Our people are deeply troubled and saddened by the destruction of these rock shelters and are grieving the loss of connection to our ancestors as well as our land.""

Australian Minister for Indigenous Affairs Ken Wyatt, who is Aboriginal, said it was ""incomprehensible"" that the blast had gone ahead, but added that it appeared to be a ""genuine mistake"".

Bulgarian-born artist Christo, best known for wrapping buildings and famous landmarks in fabric or plastic, has died at his home in New York, aged 84.

He passed away of natural causes on Sunday, according to a statement posted on the artist's official Facebook page.

Christo, who always worked with his wife Jeanne-Claude, famously covered the Reichstag in Berlin and the Pont-Neuf in Paris with reams of cloth.

His artworks ""brought people together"" around the world, the statement says.

""Christo lived his life to the fullest, not only dreaming up what seemed impossible, but realising it,"" it reads, adding that the couple's art ""lives on in our hearts and memories"".

A 2016 installation entitled The Floating Piers consisted of 100,000 sq m of bright yellow fabric floating on polyethylene cubes on Lake Iseo, in Sulzano, Italy.

Shakespeare told us 'all the world's a stage', Christo showed us all the world's an art gallery. The Bulgarian-born artist wasn't interested in the sterile white walls of the modern museum where objects exist apart from everyday life.

He wanted to turn everyday life into art, to make people look again and think again about their surroundings. He did this by way of intervention - either by wrapping a building such as the Reichstag in Berlin in blue material, or a section of the Australian coastline in one million square feet of fabric - in both cases turning cold, hard structures into sensuous, fragile sculptures.

He worked in collaboration with his wife Jeanne-Claude, whom he met in Paris in 1958. They made their first major outdoor work three years later in Germany, covering oil barrels stacked in Cologne harbour with material. Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 leaving Christo to continue alone, which he did, with a plan to wrap the L'Arc de Triomphe in Paris next year - a project that will probably still be realised.

In 2018, a Christo artwork - his first major outdoor piece to appear in the UK - was unveiled at the Serpentine in London's Hyde Park. The London Mastaba was a colourful sculpture in the shape of a trapezoid and made from more than 7,500 200-litre barrels stacked together, displayed on a floating platform.

Born Christo Vladimirov Javacheff in Gabrovo, Bulgaria, in 1935, he spent time in Austria and Switzerland before moving to France, where he met Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon in Paris.

Along with transforming large-scale landmarks, the couple also created monumental environmental works of art together in natural settings, before Jeanne-Claude's death in 2009, aged 74.

The discovery of a new breeding pair raises hope for the survival of the world's rarest primate, the Hainan Gibbon.

Ravaged by deforestation and poaching, the ape now lives only in a patch of forest on China's Hainan island.

In the 1950s, there were an estimated 2,000 left in the world, but numbers fell to fewer than 10 in the 1970s.

The latest census shows numbers have tripled to more than 30 gibbons, living in five separate family groups.

The fragile recovery follows decades of work by the Hainan Gibbon Conservation Project, run by the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Hong Kong.

""I can't imagine how sad it would be if Hainan rainforest lost this beautiful animal and its wonderful song,"" said Philip Lo, senior conservation officer.

Gibbons are known for their ability to swing gracefully through the forest canopy, making loud, haunting calls to mark their territory. Breeding adults sing duets at dawn to enhance bonding.

Villagers heard the calls of two gibbons living in a part of the forest away from the main population late last year.

A male and a female were later spotted, and heard singing together, showing they had formed a stable bond.

Gibbons are monogamous apes, forming family groups consisting of one male, two females and their young offspring. The discovery of a fifth breeding pair in a separate fragment of forest is seen as highly significant.

Philip Lo said the species remained the rarest primate in the world, but there is hope it could overcome the risk of extinction and recover steadily. He described the success as ""a piece of good news that could cheer up other dedicated conservation colleagues"".

Conservation efforts have been under way at Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve since 2003, when the first full census found only 13 individuals living in two groups.

A comprehensive rescue programme was put in place, including patrols and monitoring, research into the apes' ecology and behaviour, and the planting of thousands of trees to provide food and shelter.

Nearly 20 gibbon species exist throughout the world, from northeastern India to Borneo. Most are under threat from the destruction of forests, hunting and illegal trade.

Two species of gibbon have recently disappeared in China and all surviving Chinese species, including the Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), are classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

The number of coronavirus fatalities in Brazil has risen by almost 1,000 in a day, making the country's overall death toll the world's fourth highest.

Its figure of 28,834 has now surpassed France, and only the US, the UK and Italy have recorded more deaths.

President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently played down the outbreak, although the country has the world's second-highest number of cases.

He has criticised state lockdowns for harming Brazil's economy and jobs.

What are the latest figures?

Brazil's health ministry said the past 24 hours had seen 956 new deaths.

This puts it past France's total of 28,774. Even if new figures raised the French total back above Brazil, the trends in the two countries show deaths in the Latin American nation are on a far steeper upward trend.

According to a count by Johns Hopkins University, Brazil now has 498,440 confirmed cases.

Only the US has more, with 1.77 million.

91,Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate,https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-52842550,"['Helen Briggs', 'Bbc Environment Correspondent']","Image copyright KFBG Image caption Males are jet black; females are golden yellow

The discovery of a new breeding pair raises hope for the survival of the world's rarest primate, the Hainan Gibbon.

Ravaged by deforestation and poaching, the ape now lives only in a patch of forest on China's Hainan island.

In the 1950s, there were an estimated 2,000 left in the world, but numbers fell to fewer than 10 in the 1970s.

The latest census shows numbers have tripled to more than 30 gibbons, living in five separate family groups.

The fragile recovery follows decades of work by the Hainan Gibbon Conservation Project, run by the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Hong Kong.

""I can't imagine how sad it would be if Hainan rainforest lost this beautiful animal and its wonderful song,"" said Philip Lo, senior conservation officer.

Gibbons are known for their ability to swing gracefully through the forest canopy, making loud, haunting calls to mark their territory. Breeding adults sing duets at dawn to enhance bonding.

Villagers heard the calls of two gibbons living in a part of the forest away from the main population late last year.

A male and a female were later spotted, and heard singing together, showing they had formed a stable bond.

Gibbons are monogamous apes, forming family groups consisting of one male, two females and their young offspring. The discovery of a fifth breeding pair in a separate fragment of forest is seen as highly significant.

Philip Lo said the species remained the rarest primate in the world, but there is hope it could overcome the risk of extinction and recover steadily. He described the success as ""a piece of good news that could cheer up other dedicated conservation colleagues"".

Conservation efforts have been under way at Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve since 2003, when the first full census found only 13 individuals living in two groups.

A comprehensive rescue programme was put in place, including patrols and monitoring, research into the apes' ecology and behaviour, and the planting of thousands of trees to provide food and shelter.

Nearly 20 gibbon species exist throughout the world, from northeastern India to Borneo. Most are under threat from the destruction of forests, hunting and illegal trade.

Two species of gibbon have recently disappeared in China and all surviving Chinese species, including the Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), are classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

There is outrage in Nigeria following the murder of a 22-year-old student, Uwavera Omozuwa in a church.

The hashtag #JusticeForUwa is trending in Nigeria, with her family appealing for help to track down her killers.

Uwavera had been studying in a ""quiet"" church near her home in Benin City when she was killed, her sister, Judith, told BBC Pidgin.

The student, who had wanted to become a nurse, died in hospital on Saturday, three days after the attack.

Judith Omozuwa said her sister had also been raped.

Her family said they received a call from a woman at the Redeemed Christian Church of God on Wednesday evening.

Uwavera was taken to hospital after a security guard found her, her skirt torn and her shirt covered in blood, Judith Omozuwa said.

'Failure to curb gender-based violence'

However, a police spokesperson in southern Edo State, whose capital is Benin City, told BBC Pidgin that they were treating the incident as a murder, not a rape, case.

The student died following a fight at the church, the spokesperson added, without giving more details.

Some 30 people have been killed in eastern Burkina Faso in a gun attack on a cattle market, reports say.

Gunmen on motorbikes fired into the crowded market in Kompienga town around lunchtime on Saturday, eyewitnesses and residents said.

It is unclear who was behind the attack, but Burkina Faso has seen a recent sharp rise in jihadist violence and inter-communal clashes.

99,Coronavirus: Lockdown easing in England 'modest' - Jenrick,https://bbc.com/news/uk-52869875,[],"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robert Jenrick: ""The small changes... will have a huge impact on people's mental health""

The government is taking ""modest"" steps in easing lockdown restrictions, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said.

He said he was ""reasonably confident"" the measures would be ""manageable"", but the room for manoeuvre was limited.

From Monday in England primary schools will start to reopen and people can meet in groups of up to six.

And vulnerable people in England and Wales will be able to go outdoors for the first time in months.

Meanwhile, the UK has exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May.

Mr Jenrick's comments come after some scientific advisers voiced concerns about the timing of the changes.

Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, he confirmed the updated guidance on shielding which will mean that people who have been advised to stay home since the lockdown began will now be able to go outside either with members of their household or to meet someone from another household.

But Mr Jenrick said people in this group should only do what they are comfortable with, adding that the advice would be tightened again if conditions became ""less favourable"".

Some patients' groups have expressed concern at the pace of the changes, and have called for the evidence behind them to be published.

Confirmation of the changes to the restrictions came as it was announced another 113 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus.

It takes the total number of people who have died to 38,489.

On Saturday, Professor John Edmunds, a member of Sage - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies which advises the government - said the levels of coronavirus were still ""very high"", adding that it was a ""political decision"" to ease measures.

But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the decision to ease lockdown.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the government had ""taken evidence from scientists"" and had met the five tests it said were needed to relax restrictions.

""Because we have made that progress, steadily, slowly, surely - week in, week out - we can very gradually, very carefully, take the steps that we are taking tomorrow,"" Mr Raab said.

From Monday, a number of changes will come into effect across England:

In Wales, people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from Monday.

Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland.

And in Scotland members of two different households are already allowed to meet outdoors.

A UK cancer charity chief has told the BBC he was concerned about the new guidance allowing those who were previously shielding to go outdoors.

""It's not helpful to bring changes really quickly that we don't know the evidence behind,"" said Alasdair Rankin, Blood Cancer UK's director of research and policy. ""We'd like to see the evidence the decision is based on and for the government to be really transparent.""

And Phil Anderson, head of policy at the MS Society, said people would ""rightly want to hear a lot more about the scientific evidence showing this will be safe for them"".

Meanwhile, the UK has exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May, with 205,634 tests available on Saturday.

Widespread testing forms a central part of the government's strategy to control the virus, as it aims to ease blanket lockdown in favour of more targeted measures.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock described it as ""an important milestone on our journey to control the spread of the virus"".

While capacity for testing is over 200,000, a little more than 115,000 tests were carried out in the 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Sunday.

For several days, the government has been unable to give figures on the exact number of people who were tested.

The UK's R value - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to, on average - is currently between 0.7 and 0.9.

If it goes above 1.0 the number of cases will increase exponentially, but if it stays below then the disease will eventually peter out.

Mr Jenrick said the government would not go ahead with some of the plans to further ease lockdown if R rose above one ""or dangerously close to it"".

""We're going to be doing this in a cautious and data-driven way in the days and weeks ahead,"" he said.

101,George Floyd: What happened in the final moments of his life,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52861726,[],"Image copyright Twitter/Ruth Richardson Image caption George Floyd repeatedly told the police officers who detained him that he could not breathe

The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.

George Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Footage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor.

Mr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.

The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far.

It began with a report of a fake $20 (£16.20) bill.

A report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.

Believing the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police.

Mr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC.

But Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.

In a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but ""he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that"", according to a transcript released by authorities.

The employee said the man appeared ""drunk"" and ""not in control of himself"", the transcript says.

Shortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.

After approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.

Mr Lane, prosecutors said, ""put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car"". Then Mr Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed"".

Once handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for ""passing counterfeit currency"".

It was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued.

At around 20:14, Mr Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic"", according to the report.

Mr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.

During this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd out of the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said.

He lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.

That's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last.

Mr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.

""I can't breathe,"" Mr Floyd said repeatedly, pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"".

For eight minutes and 46 seconds, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors' report says.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Derek Chauvin is due to appear in court in Minneapolis on Monday

About six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.

One of the other officers, JA Kueng, did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but ""couldn't find one"". Yet, the officers did not move.

At 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance.

He was pronounced dead around an hour later.

On the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.

Forgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.

""The way he died was senseless,"" Harris said. ""He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.""","The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes.

Before the image of George Floyd lying under the knee of a policeman set off shock, anger and protests across the US, the arch of his life crossed crests and troughs.

There were highs, as when he, as a teenager in Houston, played American football for the 1992 Texas state champion runners-up Yates High School Lions.

There were lows, as when he was arrested for robbery in 2007 and served five years in prison.

But mostly, it would seem that Floyd, who was 46 when he died in Minneapolis on 25 May, 2020, was simply trying to live life as any other American, in search of betterment in the face of both personal and societal challenges.

His death amid a public health crisis and economic calamity that has killed more than 100,000 Americans and left over 40 million unemployed has become the latest totem of the ills that plague the country in 2020.

A native of Houston, Texas, Floyd grew up in the neighbourhood at the heart of the city's black community, the Third Ward, just to the south of the city centre.

Beyoncé grew up there, as did Bayou City's blues music scene. Drake, a Canadian rapper, paid homage to its musical vibrancy, and Floyd himself is thought to have 'spit bars' as part of the hip-hop group in the 1990s in Houston.

But poverty, racial division and economic inequalities mark its history, too, as with any American city. Marred by segregation in the 20th Century, the Third Ward Floyd left in recent years has seen gang violence and tensions over housing.

""Anytime I take somebody who's not from there, people actually are like 'man, oh my God, I've never seen poverty like this.

""It looks like a bomb went off, what happened?'"" Ronnie Lillard, a friend from the neighbourhood tells the BBC.

""People are still living in shot-gun shacks that were erected in the 1920s. The poverty is thorough... and being from that area, it's hard to escape,"" says Mr Lillard, a rapper who performs under the name Reconcile.

Floyd was well known in the council estate housing project, Cuney Homes, he adds. ""Cuney Homes is known as 'The Bricks' and if you're from there they call you 'a brickboy'. He was a brickboy.""

Growing up a gifted athlete standing at six feet six inches, friends who knew Floyd as a teenager described him as a ""gentle giant"" who shone on the field in two sports, basketball as well as American football.

""I was blown away, cause at 12 years old he was six-foot-two,"" Jonathan Veal, a childhood friend and former teammate, told local media. ""I had never seen anyone that tall before"".

At John Yates High School, he wore number 88 in the tight end position for the football team, and was later recruited to play basketball at South Florida State College in Avon Park, Florida, where he was a student from 1993 to 1995, according to CNN.

He returned to Texas for a school year at Texas A&M University, Kingsville, but did not complete his degree.

His life then took a different turn, with a string of arrests for theft and drug possession culminating in an armed robbery charge in 2007, for which he was sentenced to five years in prison.

He became involved in his local ministry, Resurrection Houston, after his release and was intent on making changes in himself and his neighbourhood, says Mr Lillard.

""While he was embracing his own life change, he was looking around at his community.""

A video of Floyd decrying gun violence, believed to be filmed in 2017, has circulated on social media, in which he implored young people to ""come home"".

His family told the Houston Chronicle he moved to Minnesota in 2018 after being encouraged by friends through a Christian work programme.

Christopher Harris, a friend and former classmate, told US media Mr Floyd ""was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning"".

""He was happy with the change he was making,"" he added.

The former athlete found work as a security guard at a local Salvation Army charity, and then took on jobs as a lorry driver and dance club bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as ""Big Floyd.""

Like many Americans, however, he found himself laid off amid mass business closures resulting from the Covid-19 crisis.

On the day of his arrest, he was said to have been attempting to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.

Anger over Mr Floyd's death has spurred protests across the US, with some descending into chaos and violence.

Over 1,600 people have been arrested in nearly two dozen cities, and the National Guard deployed in 15 states.

Mr Lillard, who described his friend as a ""person of peace"", would have supported people's rights to be heard and for change, but would not have condoned the looting or the violence.

""He had a heart bent towards forgiveness, but he also was a man of the people, too,"" he said. ""Even before his death, he was aware that people were hurting.""

""I think this thing has grown into something more than George Floyd,"" he added, speaking of the protests. ""I think you're watching frustration that America has with America [itself].""","A native of Houston, Texas, Floyd grew up in the neighbourhood at the heart of the city's black community, the Third Ward, just to the south of the city centre.

106,Our masked identities: Cartoons of India's new normal,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52792382,[],"Cartoonist Priya Kuriyan has drawn a series of pictures showing how masks became the new normal across India - even before a stringent lockdown was put in place on 25 March.

Ms Kuriyan says her art was inspired by her neighbours, as well as people she saw at the airport when she took a flight from the southern city of Bangalore to visit her friend in the eastern city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta).

This was before masks were made mandatory and flights grounded. However, the threat of Covid-19 had just begun to emerge so some people had already begun wearing face coverings as protection.

""At that point, we had no idea of the disarray the next few months would bring,"" she says.

Her cartoons are humorous snapshots of people, trying to live their normal lives amid the backdrop of the looming pandemic - like the honeymooning couple in the first picture, who Ms Kuriyan says seemed ""determined to get their honeymoon to a flying start"".

The next image - of ""Batman"" landing at the Kolkata airport was during a time she says that bats were being discussed in great detail within the context of the coronavirus' origins.

""Information about bats were just flying around,"" she says.

The next cartoon is inspired by a scene Ms Kuriyan witnessed at the Bangalore airport.

At the baggage claim belt, a group of sales girls were returning from an offsite trip, in identical sarees and masks.

""Something had clearly gone viral,"" says Ms Kuriyan.

But the masks were not only being restricted to airports. People had started wearing them every time they left their homes.

""Back in my home in Bangalore, the only people to be spotted were those from my neighbourhood who I saw during my fortnightly visits to the grocers - many of them wearing some form of homemade mask,"" she says.

But there was some creativity to be had as well.

In Kolkata, these young men seemed to be the only ones with some premonition of the chaos that was to come - and they accessorised accordingly.

But mask or no mask, some habits die hard.

Like for instance, this group of people who were still posing - and smiling - for the mandatory ""airport selfie"".

The idea of social distancing is also one that is hard to stomach for many Indians, and Ms Kuriyan says she saw many examples of ""social distancing fail"".

""On other days of social isolation, spying out from my kitchen window, to the street across my apartment, I was witness to some social distancing fail. It was a metaphor of how ironic the idea of social distancing was in a country where not even the real estate on a scooter is spared,"" she says.

110,Brothers' Home: South Korea's 1980s 'concentration camp',https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-52797527,"['Bugyeong Jung', 'Bbc Korean']","Han Jong-sun still clearly remembers the moment he was abducted with his sister.

It was a beautiful autumn day in 1984, and Han, then eight years old, was enjoying a long-hoped-for trip to the city with his busy father.

But Han's father still had a few errands to run, and he decided the quickest - and safest - thing to do would be to leave the children with an officer at a police substation for a few minutes.

That police officer would tear the family apart.

""A bus stopped in front of the police substation and we were forced into the bus,"" Han recalls more than 30 years later. ""A police officer exchanged unknown signs with the people who got off the bus.

""We had no idea where we were taken to. 'Daddy told us to wait here! Daddy is coming!' We cried and bawled.

""They started beating us, saying that we were too loud.""

The bus was taking them to Hyungje Bokjiwon, a private facility that was officially a welfare centre.

But in reality, allege those who survived, it was a brutal detention centre which held thousands of people against their will - some for years on end.

Warning: Some readers may find some of these details upsetting

According to testimonies and evidence gathered from the site, detainees say they were used as slave labour at construction sites, farms, and factories during the 1970s and 80s. They were also allegedly tortured and raped, with hundreds dying under the inhumane conditions.

The facility at Hyungje Bokjiwon has been compared to a concentration camp, but its story is not widely known, and nobody - to this day - has been held accountable for the atrocities that reportedly happened within its walls.

For Han and his sister, their arrival was the start of a nightmare which would last three and a half years, and forever change the course of their lives.

'Social Purification Projects'

In the 1980s, South Korea was booming economically. It had achieved incredible growth, overcoming the scars of the Korean War in the 1950s, after which the Korean peninsula was split into North and South.

The whole country was in a fever ahead of the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and the government began spurring on the nation's rebranding efforts.

But behind the so-called ""Miracle of Han River"" was a brutal and dark reality.

In April 1981, a letter arrived at the office of then-Prime Minister Nam Duck-woo. The letter, handwritten by President Chun Doo-Hwan, a former general who had seized power through a military coup a year earlier, ordered the authorities to ""crack down on begging and take protective measures for vagrants"".

Under the ordinance which allowed arbitrary detention of vagrants, social welfare centres were set up and buses with signs that read ""Vagrants' Transport Vehicle"" began to appear in large cities like Busan.

These welfare centres, mostly private facilities, were given subsidies from the government based on the number of people they took care of. Meanwhile, police are said to have been rewarded for ""purifying"" the streets by sending people to these centres.

Rough sleepers, disabled people, some orphan children, and even ordinary citizens who just failed to show their identification when asked, were allegedly taken to the centres as part of the ""Social Purification Projects"".

Hyungje Bokjiwon was one of the biggest of these welfare centres, not that far from a residential area in the south-eastern port city of Busan. The owner, Park In-guen, often insisted that they were there to feed, clothe and educate the vagrants.

On paper, each of the people who arrived at these centres should have only been kept inside for a year, given training and then released back into society.

The reality is that, for many, the next time they would see their friends and family again was in 1987, when the centres were forced to close after more than 30 escaped inmates blew the whistle on what was really happening behind their walls.

'Prison life'

Choi Seung-woo, another Hyungje Bokjiwon survivor, was 13 when he was taken off the streets on his way home from school.

""A police officer asked me to stop and started searching my bag,"" he told the BBC. ""There was half a loaf of bread, a leftover of my lunch which was given from school.

""He asked where I stole the bread from. He tortured me, burning my genitals with a lighter. He kept beating me, saying he wasn't going to let me go unless I confessed to the 'crime'.

""Just wanting to go home, I lied. 'I stole it, I stole it. Please let me go…'""

About 10 minutes after he says he was forced to confess to a crime he did not commit, a freezer dump truck arrived, and he was forced inside. Choi says that was the start of his ""prison life"".

He spent almost five years in Hyungje Bokjiwon, in which time he says he saw - and experienced - brutal sexual and physical violence.

To keep control of the inmates, he says, the centre was arranged like an army. Choi was placed in a platoon, under the command of another inmate who had risen to become a platoon leader, given authority to ""educate others"" and tacitly allowed to use physical force.

""The platoon leader and some other guys took all of my clothes off and poured a bucket of cold water on my body.

""While I was trying to sleep, shivering naked, the platoon leader came again and raped me. He did that to me for three consecutive nights until I was transferred to a different platoon.""

It took Choi just a week to realise that ""people are being killed here"".

""I saw a guy wearing a white robe dragging an inmate across the floor,"" he says. ""He seemed dead. He was bleeding all over his body. His eyes were rolling back. The white robe guy didn't care at all and just kept dragging the man to somewhere.

""A few days later, a guy showed some sort of resistance by asking the platoon leader some forbidden questions like 'Why are we trapped in here? Why should we be beaten?'

""Four people came and rolled him in a blanket. They kicked him all over his body until he fainted, foaming at the mouth. People took him out wrapped. He never returned to the centre. I knew that he died.""

More stories from South Korea

Aged just eight when he arrived, Han says he was the youngest in his platoon and was usually given manual work, like folding envelopes or making toothpicks.

He described the facility as ""hell"".

""The only thing I was provided from the centre was a set of blue training suits, rubber shoes, and a piece of nylon underwear.

""I rarely had a chance to take a shower. Lice were all over my body. We had rotten fish and stinking barley rice every day, literally every day. Almost all of the inmates were malnourished.

""Four people slept in zigzags on a small bed. Rape occurred every night in the corner of the dormitory.""

Some people dreamt of an escape, he says, adding that some even tried running away, but it was almost impossible to get past the guards and jump over a 7m (23ft)fence.

If you tried, failure was not an option.

""I knew that if I failed to escape, I would be beaten to death,"" Han said.

The mutual monitoring system made escape more difficult. Han says that sometimes mass escape was planned secretly, but there were always whistleblowers.

Prof Park Sook-kyung, of Kyung Hee University, who took part in a recent investigation into what happened at Hyungje Bokjiwon, pointed out the rule under which managers selected platoon leaders and gave them privileges helped maintain the whole detention system.

""The platoon leader I met said he had mixed feelings about what happened in the past. He said he saw himself as a bastard, but he did that to survive.

""If someone escaped, the platoon leader had to be punished instead.""

Some parents tried to get their children back. Choi's family searched everywhere for their beloved son.

Choi says his family tried filing missing persons reports for him and his brother, who had also been taken to the centre, but police simply ignored them.

By the mid-1980s, rumours started spreading in Busan about people being beaten to death inside the so-called welfare centre.

Confident that his children were kidnapped and trapped in the facility, Choi's father knocked on the door of Hyungje Bokjiwon. His protest led the centre managers to release the brothers in 1986.

A year later, Park In-guen, who ran Hyungje Bokjiwon, was arrested. The centre was forced to close.

Life after release was not easy though.

Choi says his life was like that of a ""beast"". His brother took his own life in 2009.

""I was still a vagrant in the eyes of the society. I could only live a life of a vagrant, a beast. No-one held out their hands for us. We were branded by the state and the people followed. Whenever I said I was in Hyungje Bokjiwon, people were afraid of me.""

Han, meanwhile, had lost contact with his sister and his father, who had also ended up in the centre.

Eventually, in 2007, he found them being treated in hospital for the mental trauma inflicted during their years at the centre.

Waiting for justice

A report into the centre by the then-opposition party published in 1987 found more than 500 detainees died under the inhumane treatment during the 12 years in which Hyungje Bokjiwon was in operation.

But nobody has ever been held to account for their deaths, nor the alleged human rights abuses which took place.

Park was eventually sentenced to two and a half years in prison only for embezzlement of state subsidies. He died of natural causes in 2016.

Two years later, the prosecutor who led the initial investigation into Hyungje Bokjiwon confessed that ""there was external pressure by the military government to stop the investigation... and demand a short sentence for Park"".

That same year, the then-prosecutor general Moon Moo-il formally apologised for the initial failures and requested that the Supreme Court review the ruling against Park, admitting that ""no proper investigation was carried out"".

Han has never given up hope of a proper investigation: he has been protesting in front of the South Korean national assembly since 2012, demanding a state inquiry into Hyungje Bokjiwon. Choi joined him in 2013. Earlier this month, Choi staged a rooftop protest and was later taken to a hospital. He's still attending psychotherapy sessions regularly.

There is some hope, though: a new report by the Busan city government, seen by BBC Korean, clearly shows that Hyungje Bokjiwon was not the welfare centre it claimed to be.

Every one of the 149 former inmates - including a ""platoon leader"" - who took part in a survey said they were held by force. A third of them have a disability, and more than half failed to receive a proper education.

The team behind the report, Prof Park says, also believes ""there was a torture room hidden inside Park In-guen's office"".

The report also shows Park's centre benefited from the systematic segregation policy supported by the Chun administration during the 1980s.

There are now signs those locked up in Hyungje Bokjiwon may finally get the justice they have waited so long for: on 20 May, the South Korean National Assembly passed a bill, ordering the allegations be looked at again.

The next day, President Moon Jae-in, who took part in the investigation in 1987 as a member of Busan District Bar Association, said that he was ""always sorry for failing to properly reveal the truth at that time"", ordering a fresh investigation.

It has given Han a sliver of hope. He has even stopped his protest in front of the national assembly.

""I've always questioned myself. 'Did I really do something wrong to be taken to the hell-like facility?' If so, was it that grave that my whole life should be destroyed?

""I don't think I could forgive the government and the people related for letting it happen. However, if they succeed in revealing what really happened in the facility and make an official apology for the victims, I would try to forgive. I will try.

""My only wish is for my family to be reunited like in the past when I was an eight-year-old boy who just loved to play with daddy and sister.""

111,Nasa SpaceX launch: What is the Crew Dragon?,https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-52840482,"['Paul Rincon', 'Science Editor', 'Bbc News Website']","Image copyright NASA Image caption Crew Dragon (right) next to the Falcon 9 rocket

The Crew Dragon launched astronauts from US soil for the first time since the last Shuttle flight in 2011. But it's a very different type of vehicle to Nasa's retired spaceplane.

Elon Musk says human spaceflight had always been the fundamental goal for his pioneering company SpaceX.

The entrepreneur achieved that ambition on Saturday 30 May 2020, when the Crew Dragon spacecraft carried Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS).

But the company had to walk before it could run. Crew Dragon evolved from an earlier design, called Dragon 1, which launched 20 times on missions to deliver cargo to the ISS between May 2012 and March 2020.

In May 2014, Musk unveiled the seven-seat Crew Dragon concept during an event at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California.

Image copyright Spacex Image caption The Crew Dragon has three different seat sizes with foam that is moulded to an individual occupant's body

Like Dragon 1, the crewed version is a capsule design, making it more similar to the Apollo command modules that carried astronauts to the Moon than the winged space shuttle concept, which was conceived to carry both a crew and a large payload.

From launch up until shortly before re-entry, the capsule is attached to a section called the trunk which has solar panels, heat-removal radiators and fins to provide stability during emergency aborts. Together, the capsule and trunk stand around 8.1m (26.7ft) tall, with a diameter of 4m (13ft).

The Crew Dragon is equipped with 16 Draco thrusters that are used to manoeuvre the vehicle in orbit. Each Draco is capable of producing 90 pounds of force in the vacuum of space.

SpaceX engineer John Federspiel, explains: ""When we wanted to take Dragon and make it human-rated, I think we took a different approach to spaceship design than has previously been done, because we wanted this to feel like a 21st Century spaceship.

Image copyright NASA

""Probably one of the biggest features of Dragon are the touchscreens on the inside. We designed them not just to be very functional, but with a user experience in mind.""

The three large displays that allow Hurley and Behnken to monitor systems and control the spacecraft are a world away from the analogue buttons, dials and control stick that featured in the cockpit of the shuttle, which flew from 1981 to 2011.

The two Nasa astronauts have been working with SpaceX to get the vehicle ready for its first crewed flight. Hurley admits that the ""glass cockpit"" took a bit of getting used to.

""As far as actual physical feedback, you certainly don't get that from the touchscreen,"" he says.

""But what you do get is an indication of where you touched and that's part of the process of flying the vehicle manually is... I touched that button and that made the vehicle go up and I got the return flash that that's what the vehicle recognised as my input.""

For the types of scenarios where astronauts might need to assume manual control of the normally autonomous craft, such as finishing off a docking sequence with the space station, the touchscreen controls are ""much more than adequate"", Hurley adds.

""It just might not be the same thing you'd want to use if you were suited up and trying to fly an entry or descent, for example, like we could do with the space shuttle,"" says Behnken.

But tailoring the spacecraft to the user experience involved more than just the design of the controls. ""When I think of comfort for the astronauts, it's really every aspect of how you could interact with the spaceship that comes to mind,"" says John Federspiel.

Image copyright SpaceX Image caption Artwork: The Crew Dragon has an innovative abort system if there's a problem during lift-off

""We have three different seat sizes, we even go so far as moulding the foam around the astronaut's body so there's not any pressure points and it's just generally a pleasurable journey into space.""

But in case anything goes wrong on the pad or during the climb to orbit, SpaceX has designed an innovative abort system for the capsule. The launch escape system (LES) consists of a set of SpaceX-designed SuperDraco engines that fire in the event of an emergency to propel the capsule and its crew safely away from the rocket.

Commenting on the LES, Doug Hurley says: ""That perspective for me is huge compared to shuttle, where there were what we call 'black zones'... scenarios where it didn't really matter if you had the right combination of failures, you were likely not going to survive.""

In addition, Hurley comments: ""The capsule design is a safer design than a winged vehicle under most circumstances.""

Behnken adds: ""The space shuttle was 10 times larger in terms of mass than you needed to get into low-Earth orbit... flying on a smaller rocket, really focused on the crew mission... provides another level of safety.""

John Federspiel explains: ""Dragon is a spaceship that's all about safety and reliability. We designed it to be two-fault tolerant, which means that any two things could fail, so I could lose a flight computer and a thruster and I could still bring the crew home safely.""

When it returns to Earth, the Crew Dragon can't simply land on a runway like the space shuttle. ""I think there's an argument that the return is more dangerous in some ways than the ascent,"" says Elon Musk.

During re-entry, the heat shield must survive temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sun, as the Crew Dragon screams through the atmosphere at up to 25 times the speed of sound.

There's a minor chance that the spacecraft's asymmetric design - driven by the placement of its emergency escape system - could cause it to roll too much. Musk has said in the past that the issue, known as roll instability, has been extensively studied, but that it still worries him.

Then, after the fiery re-entry phase, the spacecraft needs to deploy four parachutes to slow its descent.

Finally, the Crew Dragon splashes down in the Atlantic Ocean, 450km off the coast of Florida, where recovery ships will take the astronauts to safety and retrieve the capsule.

Hurley says that while he and Behnken - along with others at Nasa - provided input, ""this spacecraft - Crew Dragon - is SpaceX's design, from start to finish. Make no mistake about that"".

He adds: ""Just to see the vehicle come from not very much, a preliminary design, to where it is today, the operability of the vehicle, the clean lines, how it is inside the vehicle, how it is for a crew... we're just excited to put it through its paces.""

119,India coronavirus: Why is India reopening amid a spike in cases?,https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52808113,[],"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Within a week of reopening, India has seen a sharp spike in cases

India is roaring - rather than inching - back to life amid a record spike in Covid-19 infections. The BBC's Aparna Alluri finds out why.

On Saturday, India's government announced plans to end a national lockdown that began on 25 March.

This was expected - the roads, and even the skies, have been busy for the last 10 days since restrictions started to ease for the first time in two months. Many businesses and workplaces are already open, construction has re-started, markets are crowded and parks are filling up. Soon, hotels, restaurants, malls, places of worship, schools and colleges will also reopen.

But the pandemic continues to rage. When India went into lockdown, it had reported 519 confirmed cases and 10 deaths. Now, its case tally has crossed 173,000, with 4,971 deaths. It added nearly 8,000 new cases on Saturday alone - the latest in a slew of record single-day spikes.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fast food chains like McDonald's have begun reopening outlets in parts of India.

So, why the rush to reopen?

The lockdown is simply unaffordable

""It's certainly time to lift the lockdown,"" says Gautam Menon, a professor and researcher on models of infectious diseases.

""Beyond a point, it's hard to sustain a lockdown that has gone on for so long - economically, socially and psychologically.""

From day one, India's lockdown came at a huge cost, especially since so many of its people live on a daily wage or close to it. It put food supply chains at risk, cost millions their livelihood, and throttled every kind of business - from car manufacturers to high-end fashion to the corner shop selling tobacco. As the economy sputtered and unemployment rose, India's growth forecast tumbled to a 30-year-low.

Raghuram Rajan, an economist and former central bank governor, said at the end of April that the country needed to open up quickly, and any further lockdowns would be ""devastating"".

The opinion is shared by global consultant McKinsey, whose report from earlier this month said India's economy must be ""managed alongside persistent infection risks"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As restrictions ease, Indians are slowly getting used to the new normal

""The original purpose of the lockdowns was to delay the spike so we can put health services and systems in place, so we are able handle the spike [when it comes],"" says Dr N Devadasan, a public health expert. ""That objective, to a large extent, has been met.""

In the last two months, India has turned stadia, schools and even train coaches into quarantine centres, added and expanded Covid-19 wards in hospitals, and ramped up testing as well as production of protective gear. While grave challenges remain and shortages persist, the consensus seems to be that the government has bought as much time as possible.

""We have used the lockdown period to prepare ourselves… Now is the time to revive the economy,"" Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said last week.

The silver lining

For weeks, India's relatively low Covid-19 numbers baffled experts everywhere. Despite the dense population, disease burden and underfunded public hospitals, there was no deluge of infections or fatalities. Low testing rates explain the former, but not the latter.

In fact, India made global headlines not for its caseload but for its botched handling of the lockdown - millions of informal workers, largely migrants, were left jobless overnight. Scared and unsure, many tried to return home, often desperate enough to walk, cycle or hitchhike across hundreds of kilometres.

Perhaps the choice - between a virus that didn't appear to be wreaking havoc yet, and a lockdown that certainly was - seemed obvious to the government.

But that is changing quickly as cases shoot up. ""I suspect we will keep finding more and more cases, but they will mostly be asymptomatic or will have mild symptoms,"" Dr Devadasan says.

The hope - which is also encouraging the government to reopen - is that most of India's undetected infections are not severe enough to require hospitalisation. And so far, except in Mumbai city, there has been no dearth of hospital beds.

India's Covid-19 data is spotty and sparse, but what it does have suggests that it hasn't been as badly hit by the virus as some other countries.

The government, for instance, has been touting India's mortality rate as a silver lining - at nearly 3%, it's among the lowest in the world.

But some are unconvinced by that. Dr Jacob John, a prominent virologist, says India has never had, and still doesn't have, a robust system for recording deaths - in his view, the government is certainly missing Covid-19 deaths because they have no way of knowing of every fatality.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Indians are venturing out again but its unclear how many of them are asymptomatic.

And, he says, ""what we must aim for is flattening the mortality curve, not necessarily the epidemic curve"".

Dr John, like several other experts, also predicts a peak in July or August, and believes the country is reopening so quickly because the ""government realised the futility of such leaky lockdowns"".

A shift in strategy

So is the government gearing up for another lockdown when the peak comes?

While Dr Menon believes the lockdown was well-timed, he says it was too focused on cases coming from abroad.

""There was a hope that by controlling that, we could prevent epidemic spread, but how effective was our screening [at airports]?""

Now, he adds, is the time for ""localised lockdowns"".

The federal government has left it to states to decide where, how and to what extent to lift the lockdown as the virus' progression varies wildly across India.

Maharashtra alone accounts for more than a third of India's active cases. Add Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Delhi, and that makes up 67% of the national total.

But other states - such as Bihar - are already seeing a sharp uptick as migrant workers return home.

""Initially, most of your cases were in the cities,"" Dr Devadasan says. ""But we kept the migrant workers in cities and didn't allow them to go home. Now, we are sending them back. We have facilitated transporting the virus from urban areas to rural areas.""

While the government has said how many infections have been avoided - up to 300,000 - and lives saved - up to 71,000 - by the lockdown, there is no indication of what lies ahead.

There is only advice: The day the government began to ease restrictions, Mr Kjeriwal tweeted, urging people to ""follow discipline and control the coronavirus disease"" as it was their ""responsibility"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Social distancing will prove to be India's biggest post-lockdown challenge

Because the alternative - of curfews and constant policing - is unsustainable.

""My worry is more the circumstances of people - it's not as though they have an option to practise social distancing,"" Dr Menon says.

And they don't - not in joint family homes or one-room hovels packed together in slums, not in crowded markets or busy streets where jostling is second nature, or in temples, mosques, weddings or religious processions where more is always merrier.

The overwhelming message is that the virus is here to stay, and we have to learn to live with it - and the only way to do that, it appears, is to let people live with it.","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Within a week of reopening, India has seen a sharp spike in casesIndia is roaring - rather than inching - back to life amid a record spike in Covid-19 infections.

120,George Floyd death: Why do some protests turn violent?,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52869563,"['Helier Cheung', 'Bbc News', 'Washington Dc']","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters took to the streets again on Saturday night

Curfews have been imposed in multiple cities in the US, after unrest and protests have spread across the country over the death of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody.

Most of the protests began peacefully - and several stayed peaceful. But in a large number of cases, demonstrators clashed with police, set police cars on fire, vandalised property or looted shops. The National Guard has activated 5,000 of its personnel across 15 states and Washington DC.

Experts have also drawn parallels with the 2011 England riots - when a peaceful protest over a man who was shot dead by police turned into four days of riots, with widespread looting and buildings set alight.

How do protests spread so quickly - and why do some become violent?

Protests spread when there's a shared identity

Image copyright AFP Image caption Many of the daytime protests were peaceful

Incidents like Mr Floyd's death can ""become a trigger moment because it symbolises a broader experience, amongst much larger numbers of people, about the relationship between police and the black community"", says Prof Clifford Stott, an expert in crowd behaviour and public order policing at Keele University.

Confrontations are particularly likely when there are structural inequalities, he adds.

Prof Stott studied the 2011 England riots extensively, and found that the riots there spread because protesters in different cities identified with each other - either because of their ethnicity, or because they shared a dislike of the police.

This meant that, when the police appeared to be overwhelmed, rioters in different districts felt empowered to mobilise.

How the police respond matters

Violent protests are less likely when police have a good relationship with the local community - but how they react to demonstrations on the day also matters, experts say.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Protesters squared off against police in Los Angeles on Saturday

""Riots are a product of interactions - largely to do with the nature of the way police treats crowds,"" says Prof Stott.

For example, he says, in a large crowd of protesters, tensions may begin with just a few people confronting the police.

However, ""police often react towards the crowd as a whole"" - and if people feel that the police use of force against them is unjustified, this increases their ""us versus them"" mentality.

This ""can change the way people feel about violence and confrontation - for example, they may start feeling that violence is legitimate given the circumstances.""

Darnell Hunt, dean of social sciences at UCLA, believes police in the US ""ramped up their aggressiveness"" over the weekend.

""Deploying the national guard, using rubber bullets, tear gas, and pepper spray - these are a range of police tactics that can exacerbate an already-tense situation.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Minneapolis voices: ‘As a black American I am terrified’

It's a pattern that has been seen in other protests around the world too. For example, in 2019, Hong Kong saw seven months of anti-government protests, that began as mostly peaceful and ended up increasingly violent.

Experts highlight a series of police tactics that were seen as heavy-handed - including the firing of large amounts of tear gas at young protesters - as moves that galvanised protesters and made them more confrontational.

Prof Stott argues that police forces that have invested in de-escalation training are more likely to avoid violence at protests. He points to protests that were able to stay peaceful in the US over the weekend - such as in Camden, New Jersey, where officers joined the residents in a march against racism.

It also depends on what's at stake

Moral psychology can help explain why some protests turn violent, says Marloon Moojiman, an assistant professor in organisational behaviour at Rice University.

A person's sense of morality is central to how they see themselves, so ""when we see something as immoral, it creates strong feelings, because we feel our understanding of morality has to be protected"".

""This can override other concerns people have about keeping peace"", because ""if you think the system is broken, you're going to want to really do something drastic to show that that's not acceptable.""

This can apply to a wide range of beliefs - for example, in an extreme case, someone who thinks abortion is a moral outrage may be more likely to say it's OK to bomb an abortion clinic, he says.

Research suggests that social media echo chambers could also make people more susceptible to endorsing violence, if they believe that their peers have the same moral views as them, he adds.

Looting and vandalism can be more targeted than you think

In the US, hundreds of businesses have been damaged, and there has been widespread looting in LA and Minneapolis over the weekend.

However, Prof Stott warns that while it's easy to assume that riots and crowds are ""irrational and chaotic, none of that is true - it's highly structured and meaningful for the people taking part"".

""To some extent, looting is an expression of power - black citizens may have felt disempowered in relation to the police - but in the context of a riot, the rioters momentarily become more powerful than the police.""

Studies of previous riots show that places that get looted are often related to big businesses, and that looting ""often relates to the sense of inequality related to living in capitalistic economies"", he says.

Image copyright AFP Image caption An Apple Store in Los Angeles was among those looted

Prof Hunt has studied the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which were sparked after four white police officers were acquitted over the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King.

He says there is ""a long history of targeting, or selectivity"", in vandalism and looting. ""In the LA uprisings, you'd often see 'minority owned' spray painted on minority businesses, so that people would bypass those.""

However, both Prof Stott and Prof Hunt caution that looting is complicated - especially as lots of people with different motivations take part, including people in poverty, or organised criminals.

The idea that violent protests are targeted and meaningful events to those taking part can also explain why looting occurs in some protests, but not others.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence

In Hong Kong for example, protesters smashed shop windows, threw petrol bombs at police, and defaced the national emblem - but there was no looting.

Lawrence Ho, a specialist in policing and public order management at the Education University of Hong Kong, believes this is because those protests were triggered by political developments and anger at the police, rather than discrimination and social inequality.

""Vandalism was targeted at stores seen to have a strong connection to mainland China,"" says Dr Ho. ""It was a deliberate attempt to convey a message.""

How can violence be prevented?

Public order experts say that for the police, being seen as legitimate and able to engage protesters in dialogue is key.

""Good policing tries to avoid an 'us' and 'them' mentality, and also tries to avoid the sense that police can act in ways that people see as illegitimate,"" says Prof Stott.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police cars, including in New York, were set on fire

Dr Ho also believes that negotiation is the best way - but points out that ""one of the hardest things today is that a lot of protests are leaderless. If you can't find the leader, you can't negotiate with them.""

More generally, he adds, politicians can make matters better - or worse - based on their approach to dialogue, and whether they use emergency legislation.

Ultimately, however, riots can be a symptom of deep-seated tensions and complicated issues that don't have an easy solution.

Prof Hunt says this week's US riots are the most serious ones since 1968 - after Martin Luther King was assassinated.

""You can't think about police brutality, and the profiling of certain communities, without thinking about the inequalities that exist in society and fuel those concerns,"" he says.

121,Remote working: How cities might change if we worked from home more,https://bbc.com/news/uk-52767773,"['Roland Hughes', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright AFP Image caption The empty streets outside the New York Stock Exchange, 19 May

For many of us, our homes have become our workplaces over the past few months, and a full return to the office still appears a remote prospect.

Major tech companies say they are open to their staff working from home permanently. Employees are coming to realise remote working is not only possible but, in some cases, preferable. A shift to a new way of working might already be under way.

Such a shift could have profound implications on our home life, and by extension on the life of our towns and cities: almost a quarter of all office space in England and Wales is in central London alone.

To understand those implications, we brought together four experts on city life, all of whom were working from home.

Will city centres empty out?

Paul Cheshire, professor of economic geography, London School of Economics:

I do think we'll go back to offices but not in the same way.

People are more productive when they are closer together with face-to-face contact. There's 20 years of really good persuasive research demonstrating how important that is. There are lots of things you cannot do except with other people - people are innately social animals.

Les Back, professor of sociology, Goldsmiths:

I do think we are at a tipping point. There's a reorientation, a recalibration of the relationship between place and time and social life that we're on the cusp of. We may see profound changes. Some things may not come back.

Aude Bicquelet-Lock, deputy head of policy and research, Royal Town Planning Institute:

It's true some companies have said that they could allow their workforce to work from home forever. Twitter said it. Facebook said it. The CEO of Barclays said that putting 7,000 people in the office might be a thing of the past.

The experience of going to the office in Aberystwyth isn't the same as going to the office in London. The decline of office space will affect small, medium and large cities in different ways.

Les Back:

The hollowing-out of city life has been coming for a long time. It may be that what will happen is that some businesses won't come back to the centre of the city and think it's too risky - or there may be other economic drivers where people will just take the opportunity to ask: ""Why are we investing so much of our capital in these large office spaces?""

I think there are possibly huge effects [of more working from home]. There's the pressure on the domestic sphere. There's the pressure on gendered relationships at home, on the blurring and overlaying of parenting and work and the pressures that would cause.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tverskaya Street in Moscow, 9 May

Aude Bicquelet-Lock:

I think what we will see is that local centres may see more diversification - more dining, more social activities as people may want to meet each other. Also working from home may mean getting access to workplaces in local towns for some days. Growth is to be expected in these areas.

The contrary could apply to bigger cities, which of course raises the question of how the office space could be reused: there are several options, like turning offices into residential spaces, which hasn't always been done with absolute success.

I also wonder whether we will need conference halls and other meeting spaces as we did in the past.

Paul Cheshire:

You will get more people working from home, which will mean there will be more demand for large houses. You have to have a workspace, which will push you out. You may need to move to commute maybe once a week, twice a week to your headquarters, wherever that is, for meetings. Therefore you'll accept a longer commute for cheaper space. You'll tend to move further away from the city centre.

On the other hand, there will be people who have to stay in the offices, stay in the concentration, the social interaction, who will become even more strongly attracted to the city centre. But you will probably also get localised desk-sharing, specialised areas where people can go if you're a homeworker, where you can occasionally get better IT or better facilities or get away from your children. There will be an opening-up in smaller towns of hot-desking spaces.

Image copyright EPA Image caption An Istanbul side street, 17 May

We will need more space. What you would be doing is opening land close to stations with good access to city centres. You could build a million houses on green belt land within 45 minutes of central London because there's so much green belt land.

The fastest-growing places for people commuting to London are incredibly far away - Peterborough, York, Somerset. People are living miles out in order to get affordable land and more space. That will be accelerated. And it will be particularly accelerated unless we are willing to lease land close to transport nodes that will give access to jobs.

What about transport and the environment?

Margaret Bell, professor of transport and the environment, University of Newcastle:

Our research has shown that in a study of commuting to Newcastle the 7% of trips over 50km were responsible for 60% of the carbon emissions. The further you travel, the more detrimental effect with emissions.

Paul Cheshire:

That's one of the ironies of the green belt: forcing people to commute further.

Margaret Bell:

My worry is people buying more cars and those who have cars will use them more. What we do need is incentives to use bicycles more and to get people to shift towards living closer to their work or workplaces, or arranging for people to go to work more locally.

We need a bottom-up approach to understand people's needs and try and tailor the transport accordingly.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Birmingham New Street station, 9 April

Paul Cheshire:

Housing, particularly in England, is very energy inefficient. There's quite a big carbon footprint with more time spent in the home because home heating and home insulation is far, far worse than modern commercial premises are.

Margaret Bell:

Some work we did in Leicester showed that if you work from home, on average you use 75% more energy than you save by not going into work. And that corresponds to a 75% increase in carbon dioxide - purely and simply because if you need heating and gas, electricity at home, that's more than what you save by not going into work by car.

And so, coupled with the isolation effect, it's sensible for local businesses to open up their hot-desking offices, or even have reciprocal arrangements with companies where consultants working more out of town could reciprocate hot-desking in offices.

What about the way we use cities?

Les Back:

We are predominantly talking about people who work in finance service sectors, white-collar jobs and white-collar workers. That isn't the workforce of cities. What about hospital, school and other public sector jobs?

Also, cities are important because they're places of encounter. Places of difference. That difference and the negotiations that happen across racial and cultural difference take on particular qualities in the centre of cities that are not the same in the outskirts and in the suburbs.

Aude Bicquelet-Lock:

Everyone will have gone through the lockdown and will have gone through the changes and had new habits and will have strong views about what it is they want, what works for them and what doesn't.

And I think one of the first things we will have to do as urban planners and policymakers is listen to what they want. But there will be financial constraints.

Paul Cheshire:

The other issue is people's fear: how long will it take people to recover from the experience of being worried about being in crowds, being vulnerable. I think people will recover from that if there is a vaccine, if the virus subsides.

If that happens, offices will reassert themselves and all those things we liked doing in city centres will also reassert themselves. That may take quite a long time.

122,Libya conflict: Russia and Turkey risk Syria repeat,https://bbc.com/news/world-africa-52846879,"['Jeremy Bowen', 'Middle East Editor']","Image copyright AFP Image caption The conflict has denied Libyans access to a decent life despite its oil and gas riches

Libya looks to be at the end of one bleak chapter, but there is no guarantee that the next will be any better for a country that has been torn to pieces by civil war and foreign intervention since Col Muammar Gaddafi met his grisly death in 2011.

Since last year Gen Khalifa Haftar, the strongman of eastern Libya, has been trying to capture the capital, Tripoli, in the far west of the vast country.

Intervention by Turkey in support of the Tripoli government, recognised by the United Nations, looks to be decisive. Gen Haftar's men, along with a force of several thousand Russian mercenaries, are in retreat.

But that does not mean that Libyan civilians can expect the peace they crave. Once again they are the biggest losers.

Their country, richly endowed with oil and gas, should be able to guarantee them rights of which they can only dream: education; healthcare and a decent standard of living. They don't have any of them, or safety.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What's behind the fight for Libya?

Libyans who have not lost their homes have been locking down to prevent the spread of Covid-19, hoping they do not also become the target of artillery, drones or warplanes. The war has destroyed most of Libya's clinics and hospitals.

Around 200,000 civilians in western Libya have already been displaced from their homes, according to Hanan Saleh of Human Rights Watch.

Libya's future once looked bright

In a recent webinar organised by the think-tank, Chatham House, Ms Saleh said that ""you have to look at Libya currently as an accountability-free zone and it has been that way unfortunately since 2011"".

All parties in the war have been reckless in their treatment of civilians, though Gen Haftar's side, she said, has committed more documented abuses that could potentially be crimes of war.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Fighters loyal to the UN-backed government have pushed back Gen Haftar's forces recently

It is hard to believe now, but after Col Gaddafi was overthrown it looked for a while as if Libya might have a decent future.

Back in 2011 I walked with the British ambassador through the ruins of his embassy in Tripoli; it had been attacked and torched by a mob after Nato started bombing the Gaddafi regime's forces.

Next to the charred frame of what had been a 1920s billiard table, we talked about the pride that Libyans had in their revolution, their luck in not being cursed with significant sectarian differences like Syria or Iraq, and about the treasure house of oil and gas under the vast Libyan desert.

Perhaps even tourism would be possible. Libya has 2,000 kilometres of Mediterranean beaches, and Roman archaeological sites that are the equal of anything in Italy.

But Libya was broken, and in almost a decade since that conversation it has continued to fragment.

You may be interested in:

The militias that took on the Gaddafi regime never disbanded, and came to like their power.

Once the colonel, his sons and the family's cronies were gone, no kind of functioning state was left. The men who acquired the important job titles found that if there were any levers of government to pull, they came away in their hands.

Libyans who saw themselves as revolutionaries were in no mood to ask for much help from the powerful countries which had provided weapons and most importantly an air force to help them win.

In turn, the outsiders were relieved to be able to turn away, declaring the job was well done. Removing Gaddafi was one thing. Helping to build a country was something very different.

It did not take long for the remains of Libya to fall into even smaller pieces. The bigger towns became city-states.

The militias had their own agendas and would not lay down their weapons. A series of diplomats, mostly under the auspices of the United Nations tried, unsuccessfully, to promote dialogue and reconciliation.

Foreign powers seek Libya prize

By 2014 Gen Haftar had emerged as a power in the broken land, expelling radical Islamists from Benghazi, Libya's second city and the capital of Eastern Libya.

Gen Haftar was well known in Libya, as a general who had fallen out with Gaddafi. In exile he had spent years plotting Gaddafi's downfall from a new base in Langley, Virginia - the American town that is also the headquarters of the CIA.

Libya, in reality already in pieces, eventually found itself with two rival governments.

Gen Haftar controlled the east from Benghazi, and set about unifying the country by marching west to attack Tripoli, the capital, aiming to unseat the internationally recognised Government of National Accord led by Fayez al Sarraj.

It was certain that foreign powers would get involved in the civil war. Libya is a desirable prize. It has the biggest reserves of oil and gas in Africa, with a population of less than seven million.

Strategically, it is opposite Europe and its hydrocarbons can be exported direct to markets in the west through the Mediterranean. Rival producers in the Gulf need to ship their exports through potentially dangerous sea lanes.

Gen Haftar's most important backers are Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.

Turkey is the key ally of the Sarraj government in Tripoli.

The US has sent a variety of signals out about Libya under President Donald Trump, offering encouragement at different times to Mr Sarraj and Gen Haftar, and bombing jihadist extremists when they can find them.

Now their biggest concern is that Russia's President Putin might be establishing himself in Libya in the same way that he has dug into Syria.

Libya's war has developed disturbing similarities with Syria's. The arbiters of the fate and future of both are the same foreigners.

The proxy wars in Libya have become, in many ways, a continuation of the proxy wars in Syria. Both sides have flown in Syrian militias to apply the skills they have gained in almost a decade of war in their homeland.

It is possible that Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russia's President Vladimir Putin have applied in Libya a version of the deals they have made in Syria.

The Russian mercenaries who have fought with Gen Haftar are from an organisation known as the Wagner Group, run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of President Putin. The Wagner fighters have also been used in Syria.

It is significant that the Russian pullback from Tripoli has not been harassed by Turkey's highly efficient military drones. The Russians have also moved advanced warplanes into Libya.

The next big battle

President Putin and President Erdogan could have agreed to end Gen Haftar's offensive against Tripoli so they can split the spoils between them, according to Wolfram Lacher, a German academic who has just published a book about the fragmentation of Libya.

In the Chatham House webinar he said: ""We are talking about two foreign powers trying to carve up spheres of influence in Libya and their ambition may well be for this arrangement to be long term.""

He doubted whether the other powers involved in Libya, and the Libyans themselves, would quietly accept the arrangement.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The influence of Libya's late leader Muammar Gaddafi can still be felt in the ongoing conflict

The next big battle could be for Tarhuna, a town that lies around 90km (55 miles) south-east of the capital.

It is Gen Haftar's western stronghold, controlled by a militia known as al-Qaniyat, mainly made up of men previously loyal to the Gaddafi regime.

123,Dancing On My Own: The story behind Robyn's 2010 'sad banger',https://bbc.com/news/newsbeat-52817969,"['Steve Holden', 'Newsbeat Music Reporter']","Image copyright Getty Images

""There's a big black sky over my town.""

That line from Dancing On My Own is Robyn's love letter to the weather in her home city of Stockholm, Sweden.

It's one of her two favourite lyrics from the track, which has just turned ten years old.

It also happens to be my favourite song of all time.

That means I've spent a decade of dancing and singing to it at clubs, festivals and in friends' kitchens. It's soundtracked some of the most personal moments in my life.

Under recent lockdown, it's been viewed in another new light with an accompanying TikTok challenge from Robyn herself.

Like many other people, I love the bittersweet combination of hearing something so uplifting yet so heartbreaking.

There are so many highlights but Robyn tells me her other favourite line is: ""I just wanna dance all night.""

At that point in the song, she's already taken us to the club where we're watching her ex kiss a new partner. We've all been there, right?

She says it represents the precise moment on the dancefloor when you have to get your ""desperation, frustration and sadness out"".

It's been described as the ""ultimate sad banger"".

With its multiple cover versions and the number of films and TV shows it's popped up in, the song is considered a classic with outlets like Rolling Stone, NME and Stereogum all ranking it as the best song of the last decade.

How the song got started

By 2010, Robyn had transformed from mid-1990s major label pop star into a fiercely independent artist with her own record label, Konichiwa Records.

With Every Heartbeat had also given her a UK number one single in 2007.

Dancing On My Own was her first new music in years and the lead single from the first of her three Body Talk albums, which she released over six months.

""I knew I wanted to make a song called Dancing On My Own,"" Robyn tells Radio 1 Newsbeat, from her apartment in Stockholm. ""I just didn't know what it was going to be about.""

'It kept getting better and better'

With an idea of a chorus in her mind, Robyn started working with Swedish producer Patrik Berger, who she'd collaborated with on her previous album.

At the beginning, Patrik remembers the song having an acoustic vibe. The chorus came first and ""everything else fell into place and it felt like it was writing itself"".

Patrik admits they were ""super picky"" about every aspect of the song and he recently found a notebook with hundreds of lyrics that were written and scrapped along the way.

""Every single word needed to feel right,"" he tells Newsbeat.

His favourite lyric is ""I know where you're at, I bet she's around"" which he feels represents the ""self-destructive part of you, when we know we shouldn't go there. It's like scratching a wound.""

Robyn also remembers Patrik spending a lot of time on the individual components of the song: the drums, the bass and the pounding staccato it starts with.

""We kept building and it kept getting better and better and better"", she says.

""It was an exciting session. I remember sending the demo to the record label and telling them I thought we had a good single.""

A 'magical moment' on TV

Robyn says she's proud of Dancing On My Own because it features elements of ""many different worlds"" she loves including: ""Prince songs, 80s rock ballads and queer electronica"".

The song was a hit. Dancing On My Own made number eight in the UK Singles Chart.

It went on to top year-end critics' polls, Robyn performed it on TV shows around the world and it was nominated for a Grammy.

Then came the first of Robyn's two defining moments in the life of her song. We'll get to the second later.

In 2012, it was used in the first season of HBO's Girls, the TV comedy drama created by Lena Dunham.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lena Dunham created Girls and says Robyn creates 'universal yet personal' songs

Robyn says the use of the song was ""genius"" while Lena Dunham tells Newsbeat it was ""magical"".

In the episode, Lena's character Hannah finds out her ex-boyfriend is gay. She's sat in her flat and Dancing On My Own starts up on her laptop.

Her best friend Marnie (Alison Williams) comes home and they dance in Hannah's bedroom to the track, which then plays over the end credits.

""That moment on set was meant to be so brief and so light,"" says Lena. ""But it took on so much importance because it marked the first time myself and Alison felt comfortable in our characters.

Off camera she says the whole crew was dancing and people were crying.

""You could feel the power and love that went into the song.""

When Lena accepted her Golden Globe for best actress in 2013, Dancing On My Own was playing as she walked to the stage collect it.

""It was like having a companion in that very public moment.""

Dancing On My Own has also been featured in Gossip Girl, Orange Is The New Black, RuPaul's Drag Race, movies Teen Spirit and Long Shot, and the Masked Singer USA.

'I owe my career to Robyn'

It's also been covered multiple times by artists including Kings Of Leon and Kelly Clarkson.

""I really like Kelly's version,"" says Robyn. ""She has a really powerful voice. She recorded one of my favourite Max Martin songs, Since U Been Gone, which I covered in the Radio 1 Live Lounge. So that's funny.""

But its most famous cover is by Calum Scott, who gave the song a second lease of life.

In 2015, the British singer auditioned for Britain's Got Talent with a stripped-back version of the track, the video of which has now been viewed 288 million times.

""I fell in love with the song instantly,"" he says. ""I was about 21 when it was originally released and it came at the height of me figuring out my personality.""

Image caption Calum Scott launched his career on Britain's Got Talent

He points to the lyric ""I'm right over here, why can't you see me?"" as the precise moment he connected to the song.

Calum struggled with his sexuality growing up. He says Dancing On My Own became his anthem.

""I didn't really know who I was, so when I sang it all those emotions from my past spilled over into the song.""

Calum's version was released commercially in 2016 and performed better than Robyn's original, reaching number two in the UK singles chart.

""I owe my career to Robyn,"" he says.

He also describes the ""surreal moment"" when the two of them met - by chance - at the BBC.

""She walked past and I just froze. She came up to me and said it was nice to finally meet me. You never expect to meet the person who had the original song"".

Robyn says Calum and his voice interpreted it in a way that ""made the song came alive again"".

""I'm super happy for him to have the success and am pleased people got to know the song a little bit more"".

She says there have been so many covers because ""it's a great song.""

'Tired of the broken heart'

But as Calum was bringing the song to a far wider audience in the mid-2010s, Robyn was taking a step back from what she'd created.

""Dancing On My Own sometimes felt like a teenage version of me that I was happy to let go of,"" she says.

The song came from a break-up in her own life and she became ""tired of the broken heart"".

""I went through a lot of therapy, worked on myself and healed myself.

""Now I'm back loving it. I don't feel conflicted and I love performing it and playing it live.""

When Robyn toured in 2019, she cut the song just before the chorus, leaving thousands of fans to sing her track back at her.

I was at her gig at London's Alexandra Palace. It was such a goosebump moment to join everyone else singing ""I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her"" at the tops of our voices.

At the time, I remember Robyn seemed to be genuinely overwhelmed by it.

""It's like the song was talking back to me,"" she says.

By that point, she felt the song had moved on from its beginnings and ""became something that took on meaning for a lot of people in different ways"".

For someone that often writes about heartbreak and emotions, Robyn says she finds nostalgia and sentimentality ""difficult"".

""Those emotions don't always feel true to me and I think Dancing On My Own has those qualities.

""It's maybe a part of the song I had to struggle with. But maybe that's why it connects to so many people too.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption FKA Twigs, Christine & The Queens, Robyn and Charli XCX at the NME Awards 2020

In February, Robyn was named Songwriter of the Decade at the NME Awards, an accolade handed to her by Christine & The Queens and Charli XCX.

Charli says Robyn ""continuously evolved"" in her career but ""has always stayed true to who she is"".

Héloïse Letissier of Christine & The Queens described her songwriting as ""pop perfection"".

""As a songwriter I can only marvel at a song like Dancing On My Own,"" says Letissier. ""It's a gem of pop. I watched her gig in Oslo last year and it was the most cathartic thing I ever saw.""

As we mentioned earlier, Robyn has a second defining moment of the track.

It involves her friend and collaborator Max Martin, who himself has co-written 22 Billboard Hot 100 number ones and played an early part in her career on songs like Show Me Love.

According to Robyn, she was told by his manager that Max thinks ""it's one of the best pop songs ever made"".

""And that makes me very happy and proud.""

124,Carly Fiorina's journey from secretary to CEO,https://bbc.com/news/business-52820298,"['Dave Gordon', 'Business Reporter']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Carly Fiorina now spends most of her time on her philanthropy work

The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Carly Fiorina, US business leader, political figure and philanthropist.

It should give hope to any young person striving to reach the top, knowing that Carly Fiorina started her business career as a humble secretary.

""I spent my time greeting visitors, answering phones, typing memos,"" she says. ""But I was really committed to the job, arriving early, and leaving late.""

Mrs Fiorina, 65, is looking back on her 21-year-old self, who in 1976 got her first full-time job at a small property company in Palo Alto, California.

From that modest start she went on to become the first female chief executive of a Fortune 50 company (the 50 largest firms in the US). This happened in 1999 when, aged 44, she was appointed to the top job at computer group Hewlett-Packard.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption She was in her mid-40s when she got the top job at HP

Fortune magazine subsequently named her the most powerful woman in US business five years in a row, with the publication declaring that ""Carly Fiorina didn't just break the glass ceiling, she obliterated it"".

However, her time at HP was not universally regarded as a success, with much criticism of her decision to merge the business with rival Compaq in 2001. And in 2005 she resigned after a disagreement with her fellow board members.

Mrs Fiorina subsequently entered the political arena, first as an adviser to the late John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. McCain went on to lose the election to Barack Obama.

Eight years later, she herself ran to become the Republican Party candidate for the 2016 presidential election. She dropped out after nine months, due to low polling numbers, with Donald Trump going on to win both the candidacy and, of course, the presidency. She said at the time that she was ""horrified"" by Trump.

Image copyright Carly Fiorina Image caption She married her husband Frank in 1985

Born in 1954 in Austin, Texas, her family moved around a lot, due to her father's job. Her dad, Joseph Sneed, was a law professor who went on to become US deputy attorney general. Her mother was a painter.

She got a degree in philosophy and medieval history from Stanford University in California, before gaining a Master of Business Administration from the University of Maryland.

In 1980 she entered the technology sector when she joined US giant AT&T as a management trainee. Her rise at the company was meteoric. By 1990 she was the firm's first female vice president, and by 1995 she was a senior director at AT&T spinoff Lucent Technologies.

It was also while at AT&T that she met her husband Frank, and they were married in 1985.

Mrs Fiorina's success at the telecoms giant caught the attention of HP, who were looking for a fresh start after missing nine quarterly profit targets in a row. She was appointed to the top job at the company in July 1999.

""When I arrived at HP I purposely brought no-one new in at the beginning,"" she says. ""I did that for a very explicit reason, which was to send a very clear message to the organisation that we could, and we would, figure out what the problem was, and we would fix it.

""[However], I was brought in by the board to transform the company. Those were the words they used.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mrs Fiorina went up against Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential candidacy debates

Under Mrs Fiorina's leadership, costs were reduced, and eventually 30,000 jobs were removed from the combined 145,000 HP and Compaq workforce. A further 80,000 employees took pay cuts at a business which at its peak was worth $87bn (£71bn).

""Of course it is incredibly difficult to have to fire people, to have to lay people off,"" she says. ""In that very difficult circumstance, the best I could do was to fully explain why.

""Why are we having to lay people off? Because if we don't, we will go out of business like many of our peers.""

When the merger between HP and Compaq went ahead in 2002, it was the biggest ever in the technology sector at the time, and created the world's largest seller of personal computers.

Whether the merger was a success, however, is still hotly contested. Tech website ZDNet said in 2016 that HP and Compaq's coming together was ""the worst merger ever"". By contrast, the Huffington Post called it ""the merger that worked"".

What is certain is that the HP board were unhappy with the profits and share price of the combined business, and Mrs Fiorina was asked to resign in 2005. Her severance package was reportedly worth $21m.

Image copyright Carly Fiorina Image caption She now teaches charities leadership skills

""We did, in fact, restore a great company,"" she says. ""[But] we had a dysfunctional board. It was dysfunctional when I arrived. It was dysfunctional when I left.""

If leading HP wasn't enough of a battle, Mrs Fiorina jumped into politics for a decade from 2006. After working for John McCain, she went on to stand as the Republican candidate in the 2010 US Senate election in California, but lost out to the Democratic Party incumbent.

Mrs Fiorina then worked for the American Conservative Union, a right-wing lobbying organisation, before running to be the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. Looking back on this campaign, she says that ""the process itself is insane"".

She adds: ""Meaning, when you think about the process the candidates go through, does it really help someone to be a better leader? Does it help us to decide a better leader? I don't think so.

""It is a really crazy process that goes on for far too long. It is far too driven by a media spectacle.""

But with another US presidential election due to be held this autumn, what does she think of President Trump after his four years in office? She declines to comment.

More The Boss features:

While the worlds of politics and business can be tough, Mrs Fiorina's biggest fight came in 2009 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and subsequently required a double mastectomy.

She says the experience taught her a great deal. ""While I hope to never go through cancer again, it was a very important part of my journey, and for that I'm grateful.

""I learned and grew so much during this time - learned about love and friendship, grew in my faith, and valued the kindness of strangers.""

Technology firm boss Mihai Ivascu says that Mrs Fiorina is an ""inspirational leader"".

""She does not limit herself to what she is expected to do,"" says Mr Ivascu, who runs London-based M3 Holdings, and was included on a ""Forbes 30 Under 30"" list of leading young entrepreneurs. ""And as she has said, leadership is about changing the status quo when it needs changing.""

In recent years Mrs Fiorina, who lives with her husband in Washington DC, has dedicated most of her time to her charity work. This includes being the chair of Good360, which helps companies give their surplus merchandise to various charities, and running Unlocking Potential, which helps the bosses of charities improve their leadership skills.

Looking back on the start of her career, and her days as a secretary, she says: ""I was going to be the best secretary out there. I had no idea where it would lead.""","It should give hope to any young person striving to reach the top, knowing that Carly Fiorina started her business career as a humble secretary.

125,"Amazon under threat: Fires, loggers and now virus",https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-51300515,"['Camilla Costa', 'Visual Journalism Americas']","So what is driving deforestation in each of the Amazon nations, how much primary forest have they lost and what are their governments doing?

""People have no idea what it would mean to lose this magnificent hydrological system.""

Antonio Nobre says: ""The ring made by central-southern Brazil and the River Plate basin would be a desert if it wasn't for the Amazon.

It affects the ecosystem of the whole region, including those who are not part of the Amazon itself, and beyond.

More than 33 million people live in the Amazon - about 8% of the population of South America - in towns, cities, riverside communities and indigenous villages. There are at least 100 tribes who have had little or no contact with outsiders.

Deforestation and its causes are a major source of friction between the governments of the nine Amazon nations, environmentalists, companies and indigenous groups: the desire for economic development clashes, in the main, with the preservation of the Amazon and its native peoples .

That doesn't seem an easy task in the near future.

""If we could restore 60,000 or 70,000 sq km in this large area, where the dry season is already much longer, we could help the forest get back to working better and it would be more resilient.""

""First, we should adopt a zero deforestation policy in Panamazonas, immediately, together with a reforestation programme in the south, south-east and east of the Amazon, which are the most vulnerable areas.""

According to Carlos Nobre, there is a way.

""Replacing the rainforest with another ecosystem, this increase could be even greater or could happen sooner.""

""Even if the conditions we have at the moment stay the same, temperatures in the Amazon region could increase by 8C, taking into account deforestation and global warming by 2070.

And temperature increases could lead to more heat-related cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, says Beatriz Oliveira, from Brazil's Climate Change Investigations Network (Red-Clima).

The process of degradation could make the insects look for other sources of food and get closer to urban settlements.

Some studies link deforestation to an increase in illnesses transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria and leishmaniasis.

This could have a catastrophic impact on the local economy. Less rain and higher temperatures mean less water for animals or growing crops like soya.

But Brazilian climatologist Carlos Nobre, says temperatures in the region could increase by 1.5-3C in the areas which become degraded savannahs. And that is without taking into account possible increases already caused by global warming.

Scientists can't say exactly what a sudden transformation of the Amazon rainforest would mean.

This means it could be even closer than they think. But what could happen after the tipping point?

The projection, however, still does not take into account degradation because of the difficulty of measuring it across Panamazonas - the joint Amazon biome across the different national borders.

It would cause the length of the dry season and temperatures in the forest to increase. Trees would start to die and the tropical rainforest could become more like a dry savannah.

This will happen when total deforestation reaches between 20% and 25% - and that could happen in the next 20 or 30 years.

We could be dangerously close to what scientists call ""the tipping point"" - when the nature of the Amazon will completely change.

If deforestation and degradation continue at current levels, the Amazon could stop working as a tropical ecosystem, even if some of it is still standing.

Among the Amazon countries, only Brazil regularly publishes annual degradation figures. However, scientists from across the region are trying to produce the relevant data to form a wider picture of the current state of the forest.

""It is a difficult phenomenon to measure because although you can see degradation on satellite images, you need to have data from the ground to understand the real picture - whether that area is more or less degraded or is recovering,"" says Alexander Lees.

So why don't they talk about degradation when measuring forest loss in the Amazon?

A recent report by the Colombian government confirms that between 2012 and 2015, its own Amazon region lost 187,955 hectares of forest to deforestation and 414,605 hectares to degradation - more than double.

Dr Nobre says the degraded areas of the Amazon are nearly twice as big as the deforested areas.

If we take the deforestation and degradation together, more than 50% of the Amazon no longer performs environmental services for the region's climate, says Antonio Nobre.

Degradation also makes the forest less efficient. It loses, for example, the ability to generate some of its own rain.

And in seven of the nine Amazon countries, they say, degradation is the main source of their carbon dioxide emissions.

Scientists also warn that degradation is an important factor in releasing stored CO2. A new study by Raisg says 47% of all the emissions in the Amazon are as a result of degradation.

""Even though not all the vegetation is lost, the soil is drier and more fragile. This changes the microclimate of the forest and makes it easier for fires to spread because the soil heats up faster,"" explains Dr Alexander Lees, Senior Lecturer in tropical ecology at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK.

This phenomenon is as much the result of climatic events - such as drought, as human action - such as burning or illegal logging which strip the forest of its vital functions. However, seen from above, it may seem that the forest is still standing.

Experts like Antonio Nobre believe that deforestation does not show the full picture of what is being lost and we should also take into account ""degradation"".

A recent study claimed that 20% of the Amazon is already emitting more CO2 that it absorbs.

For this reason, scientists fear that the Amazon will stop being a carbon store and will instead become a serious emitter of CO2, accelerating the effects of climate change.

One of the direct effects of deforestation is that it releases CO2 stored in the forest. Forest fires or the decomposition of felled trees both transform the carbon within the tree back into gas.

According to Dr Berenguer, a large tree (with at least three metres circumference) can contain between three and four tonnes of carbon. This is the same as about 10 to 12 tonnes of CO2, or what a family car emits over four years.

The older and larger the tree, the more carbon it stores.

A small part of the CO2 absorbed by trees during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere during respiration. The rest is transformed into carbon which the trees use to produce the sugars needed for their metabolism.

Primary forest is home to trees that can be hundreds or even thousands of years old. They perform a powerful role in mitigating the effects of climate change, as they act as an enormous carbon dioxide store.

In the last 10 years, figures for primary forest loss have remained high or spiked in most of the Amazon nations.

""Each hectare deforested means part of the ecosystem ceases to function and this affects the rest,"" says Oxford University rainforest expert Erika Berenguer.

This may seem insignificant - only 0.32% of the forest in the whole Amazon biome - but it is also a question of quality.

A football pitch is frequently used as a reference because, according to Fifa, the maximum size of a pitch is 1.08 hectares. However, some countries use smaller dimensions, which is why deforestation calculations can vary so much.

Almost half of this was primary forest - 1.7 million hectares of forest that was still in its original state and rich in biodiversity. Its destruction was the same as three football pitches of virgin forest being destroyed every minute in 2018.

In 2018 alone, the tree cover loss in the Amazon reached four million hectares (40,000 sq km), according to Global Forest Watch.

The most common way of measuring deforestation is ""tree cover loss"" - where forest vegetation has been completely erased.

Scientists say that if we don't reverse current levels of deforestation and degradation, the consequences of climate change could accelerate.

Even if an area does not lose all its trees and vegetation, degradation strips the rainforest of properties that are vital to the planet.

This happens when a combination of pressures on a stretch of forest - such as fires, logging or unlicensed hunting - make it hard for the ecosystem to function properly.

To get a more complete sense of the scale of the destruction, Dr Nobre says it is necessary to take into account the figures for degradation.

""The destruction of the Amazon rainforest up till now is much bigger than the almost 20% that they talk of in the media.""

""To only speak of deforestation when we refer to the loss of the Amazon is what I call ""the great green lie"","" says climate scientist Antonio Donato Nobre.

But that is not the only problem.

Brazil and Bolivia were among the top five countries for loss of primary forest in 2018 and both saw a dramatic increase in wildfires last year.

Even before this year’s spike in deforestation, the rate across the nine Amazon countries had continued to rise.

The Brazilian authorities are deploying troops in the Amazon region to help protect the rainforest, tackle illegal deforestation and forest fires. But critics say that the government’s rhetoric and policies could actually be encouraging loggers and illegal miners.

Last year, an unprecedented number of fires devastated huge swathes of forest in the Amazon. Peak fire season is from July which some experts worry could coincide with the peak of the coronavirus crisis.

In April, as the number of cases rose and states started adopting isolation measures, deforestation actually increased 64% compared with the same month in 2019, according to preliminary satellite data from space research agency INPE.

But many of the field agents working to protect reserves have pulled out, Jonathan Mazower, of Survival International, says, allowing loggers and miners to target these areas.

As elsewhere, social distancing and travel restrictions have been imposed to limit the spread of the virus.

Since coronavirus spread to Brazil, in March, Amazonas has been the state to register Brazil's highest infection rates - it also has one of the most underfunded health systems in the country.

The largest and most diverse tropical rainforest in the world is home to 33 million people and thousands of species of plants and animals.

Here, we look at the pressures pushing the Amazon to the brink and ask what the nine countries that share this unique natural resource are doing to protect it.

Deforestation, illegal mining, land clearances and wildfires were already at an 11-year high and scientists say we're fast approaching a point of no return - after which the Amazon will no longer function as it should.

Deforestation jumped 55% in the first four months of 2020 compared with the same period last year, as people have taken advantage of the crisis to carry out illegal clearances.

The Amazon rainforest - which plays a vital role in balancing the world's climate and helping fight global warming - is also suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The fires which started in Bolivia in May 2019 destroyed almost two million hectares of forest, according to the Friends of Nature monitoring NGO.

Half of that was in protected areas, known for their wide biodiversity.

Environmentalists say Evo Morales' government has promoted deforestation with policies of selling land in the Amazon region to businessmen and distributing it to farmers.

The expansion of the farming frontier is mainly to encourage soya planting and cattle raising, in the hope of building exports for the Chinese market. In August 2019, Mr Morales celebrated the first beef exports to China from Santa Cruz.

The same region was responsible for nearly half of Bolivia's soya production in 2018 and was most affected by the fires last year.

In response to criticism during the fires crisis, Morales halted land sales in Santa Cruz for what he called ""an ecological pause"".

We asked the Bolivian environment ministry about its strategy to reduce deforestation, but have had no response.

Brazil Amazon area: 421.3 million hectares Primary forest lost: 18%

Brazil received international acclaim for the drop off in deforestation between 2004 and 2014 - an accumulated fall of 80% in almost 10 years.

But the loss of forest has once again started to rise.

In November 2019, the government published data confirming expert predictions: that between the middle of 2018 and the middle of 2019, deforestation in the Amazon had increased 30% in relation to the previous year.

They had cleared around 980,000 hectares (9,800 sq km), the largest area of forest cut down since 2008.

And these figures don't take into account August 2019, when Amazon fires were at their worst.

President Jair Bolsonaro's government claimed the fires were down to the dry season. But investigations by IPAM and the Federal University of Acre found otherwise.

According to their report, the Amazon fires are directly related to deforestation.

""After felling the trees, they leave it to dry for a few months then set fire to it to clear the vegetation. The land is then used to plant grass and create pastures,"" says Erika Berenguer.

According to the FAO, 80% of tree loss in Brazil is directly or indirectly related to cattle farming. Brazil is the largest beef exporter in the world. It makes up 7% of the country's GDP and 4.6% of exports.

Today, around 40% of the country's cattle is raised in Amazon states. But that is only part of the story.

Around 60 million hectares of the Brazilian Amazon are considered public areas, or rather they have no legal purpose defined by the government.

They are not conservation areas, nor indigenous territories, for example. People clear this land, cut the trees down and put cattle on them, it's the cheapest way to occupy them, says Stabile.

A patch of land without trees is worth more on the market.

The primary use of deforested land in Brazil is cattle. But the aim is not necessarily to earn money from meat production but from the sale of land Marcelo Stabile, of IPAM, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute

The next step in the chain is to illegally obtain a title deed for the land and sell it, says Mr Stabile. They then find another patch of forest and start again. The land is often sold to large-scale farmers and it is hard to tell which was cleared legally and what wasn't.

The same happens in Colombia, Peru and Ecuador.

According to Mr Stabile and other investigators, Brazil could double or triple its number of cattle without felling another hectare of the Amazon rainforest.

""What's happening is land speculation,"" he says. ""If the government defined these public areas, it would cease to be lucrative.""

Environmentalists and investigators say statements and policies from Bolsonaro's government are encouraging clearances and the persecution of indigenous people.

Although the government denies this, the president has said he wants to end the ""industry of environmental taxes"" and believes the country has too many conservation areas. The government also wants to allow mining on land belonging to indigenous tribes.

Between January and September 2019, attacks and invasions of indigenous people's land increased 40% on the previous year. The finger of blame is pointed at those involved in land clearance, logging and mining.

However, as the coronavirus crisis took hold in May, around 4,000 troops were mobilised in the Amazon against illegal logging and other activities until June, although that could be extended into the dry season to help with fire prevention.

Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said the coronavirus outbreak had ""aggravated"" the situation this year.

President Bolsonaro, however, has spoken against punitive measures taken against loggers and miners - such as the destruction of their equipment when it can't be taken out of the forest. Critics say that sends a message that the government is on their side.

Colombia Amazon area: 48.5 million hectares Primary forest lost: 11.7%

In 2017, the level of deforestation in Colombia was one of the biggest in the Amazon region and the highest in the country's history. More than 140,000 hectares of forest was cleared, twice the previous year's total.

This peak was a result of the peace accord with Farc rebels in 2016, which left a power vacuum in forested areas.

Community leaders said Farc had acted as a type of environmental police, controlling when farmers were allowed to clear the forest or burn for agriculture or cattle farming.

""Government officials wouldn't come near the Amazon region because of Farc, who, for their own protection, had an interest in keeping the trees standing. So the rebels could establish strict rules,"" said Rodrigo Botero, director of Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development.

However, Colombia is now facing a race to clear land in the Amazon led by large-scale farmers, local authorities, drug dealers and other paramilitary groups such as the ELN, says Botero.

There is a market for land and the government can't stop it, he says.

The Colombian government formed a National Council for the Fight against Deforestation in an attempt to tackle the issue.

The group works to identify pockets of deforestation, the causes and what action is needed, according to the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development.

Laws passed in 2018 made the protection of water, biodiversity and the environment priority issues in matters of national security. The government can now intervene to protect areas in the Amazon national park from illegal activities.

They are also carrying out military operations against people clearing land and launching programmes which promote financial incentives for conservation.

But in 2018, deforestation rates only fell by 4%. By 2018, Colombian had lost around 11.7% of its original forest - 14% of which was in the last eight years.

In the north of Ecuador, palm oil production is the main threat to the Amazon, experts say.

The oil is used worldwide in the industrialised production of food such as chocolate, cosmetics, cleaning products and fuels.

Ecuador is the second biggest producer of palm oil in Latin America, and the sixth worldwide.

The expansion of palm oil and cocoa plantations in the last 10 years is the main driver of deforestation, according to Global Forest Watch and Maap.

This is particularly worrying because despite only covering about 2% of the Amazon biome, Ecuador has one of the most diverse parts of the forest. In just one hectare of the Yasuní park area, you'll find 670 tree species - more than in the whole of North America.

Furthermore, according to a study by the country's National Institute of Biodiversity, between 40% and 60% of the species of trees in Ecuador's Amazon region are still unknown.

Mining boom

Mining projects and oil exploration in the Amazon have also made headline news in Ecuador.

One such project is Mirador, an open mine for copper, gold and silver which will be built in two Amazon provinces. It is the biggest project of its type in Ecuador - but not the only one.

The government says industrial mining in the region, carried out by a Chinese company, will be responsible and the income generated will allow investment in infrastructure locally.

However, investigators believe the activity could bring with it serious problems to the Amazon.

""As well as deforestation, we don't know exactly where they are going to put the dams nor how they are going to monitor them,"" said Carmen Josse, scientific director of the EcoCiencia Foundation.

At the start of 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron suspended a gold mining megaproject within the Guianan Amazon National Park, which he had initially approved at the start of his tenure. The suspension was the result of national and international campaigns.

Despite this, illegal mining is the main threat to the park. Security forces have detected an increase in the number of illegal mines in the area since 2017.

With a population of less than 300,000 people, French Guiana has between 8,000 and 10,000 illegal miners. The rising price of gold since the 2008 financial crisis has sparked a rush to find the metal in the forests of the world.

Ninety five per cent of Guyana is covered by the Amazon.

The country proposes two ways of treating the forest which, for many, seem irreconcilable. On the one hand, it is looking for a way of exploiting it economically while at the same time selling itself as a Green State that protects the Amazon.

Part of its success is due to strategies such as the creation of a forest management commission, which decides which trees can or cannot be cut down.

However, legal felling controlled by the government is still considered a factor that enables deforestation. According to environmentalists, licences for large international logging companies create access to virgin forest which illegal miners take advantage of.

Guyana's Forestry Commission says it has not opened any new areas of the forest for legal felling since 2015.

In fact, some areas were taken back off the companies who had licences to exploit them and they have become conservation areas, the government said.

Illegal mining - mainly gold - is to blame for 85% of the forest loss, according to the Forestry Commission. Gold is the country's main export.

The government says it has a ""Green State development strategy"" for the country which includes more investment in ecotourism and renewable energy, stricter limits on CO2 emissions and increasing forest conservation.

All this is funded by international agreements to preserve the Amazon and the discovery of huge oil reserves at sea.

Small scale agriculture has traditionally been the main cause of deforestation in Peru. Recently, however, cultivation of palm oil, cocoa and coca are catching up.

A 2018 study found that despite making up only 4% of crops in the Amazon, palm oil was responsible for 11% of deforestation between 2007 and 2013. The oil is used worldwide to produce food, cosmetics and fuel.

After some palm oil producers were fined for deforestation, they started to buy land from small farmers who had already cleared the forest illegally, says Sandra Rios, geographical engineer with the Instituto de Bien Comun (IBC Peru).

Illegal gold mining poses an increasing risk to the Peruvian Amazon. Peru is the biggest exporter of gold in Latin America, and the sixth worldwide. However, experts say up to 25% of its annual production comes from illegal mining.

Since 2006, Peru has been experiencing a new gold rush in the Tambopata Nature Reserve, one of the most biodiverse in the region, driven by rising gold prices and the construction of the Brazil-Peru Transoceanic Highway.

The road, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic, not only makes travelling easier, it also opens up previously inaccessible areas of the forest. The group of miners in the area, known as the La Pampa, has grown to have more than 5,000 members.

The miners strip the vegetation from the Amazon soil to look for gold. They use mercury to separate the precious metal from others, poisoning the waters and local animals in the process.

In 2017, the loss of forest as a result of mining reached its highest level since 1985, according to the Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation (Cincia).

2016: A report by the Amazon Andes Monitoring Project says 350 hectares have been deforested as a result of illegal mining in the Tambopata reserve

2018: At its peak, La Pampa had more than 5,000 active miners. In 2019, a military operation targeted the mining camp

Last March, the government declared a state of emergency for 60 days to carry out military operations against miners in la Pampa.

Suriname Amazon area: 14.7 million hectares Primary forest lost: 4%

With almost 94% of its territory within the Amazon, Suriname is one of the countries with the best track record of conservation in biome.

However, since 2012 Suriname has recorded an increase in the loss of forest, mainly as a result of gold mining.

Between 2000 and 2014, the extent of mining areas, generally on a small scale industrial or artisanal mines, increased by 893%, according to the Foundation for Forest Management and Production Control.

The government foundation says mining is responsible for 73% of the country's deforestation.

Suriname is 10th in the world for gold production relative to its size. And that's without mentioning illegal mining.

Most illegal mining takes place in remote areas of the forest, far from the authorities. It is believed that up to 60% of the gold miners in Suriname are Brazilians who cross the border illegally.

In some of the larger areas belong to indigenous tribes or descendents of slaves, mining has become the main source of income for families.

Venezuela Amazon area: 47 million hectares Primary forest lost: 4%

There are no current official figures available for deforestation in Venezuela, but monitoring by local and international scientists show forest loss has increased in the last few years - especially since the creation of the Orinoco Mining Arc.

With the dramatic fall in oil prices and production in Venezuela since 2014, the Maduro government has focused its attention at states rich in minerals - such as the Amazon.

Venezuela has the sixth largest natural gold reserve in the world, with around 7,000 tonnes.

The mining arc, created in 2016, allowed licences for mining precious metals such as gold, diamonds and coltan (a combination of columbite and tantalite used in the production of mobile phones) across an area of 112,000 sq km, about 12% of the country.

The area also covers natural landmarks, forest reserves, an Amazon national park and at least four designated indigenous territories.

""The Orinoco zone is traditionally a mining area, even the indigenous people did it,"" says ecologist Peláez, from the NGO Provita.

""But the law, in some ways, legalised forms of mining that were already in place and did not help reduce activity. This has had an enormous impact on the environment and the local population.""

Maduro's plan was to grant concessions to foreign mining companies which would have to form businesses together with state-owned companies in order to operate in the area.

In practice, according to Mr Peláez, this resulted in an exponential growth in small-scale mining.

In 2018 alone, according to the Central Bank of Venezuela, the state bought 9.2 tonnes of gold on the internal market - the same as the total amount for 2011-2017.

It's having a devastating effect on the region.

""The gold that is there is of very poor quality, it's dirty,"" says Mr Peláez. ""The amount that is coming out of the ground is very small.""

People are destroying the forest and digging wherever they can. They're leaving sterile sand where nothing can grow. The deforestation in this zone is irreversible Carlos Peláez, Provita

Mining is producing tonnes of sediment that is accumulating in the country's main rivers. The use of mercury to separate gold from impurities, is poisoning rivers and indigenous people.

Venezuela has the most illegal mines in the Amazon, according to a study by Raisg. There are 1,899 illegal mines, concentrated in the Orinoco mining arc.

In the midst of Venezuela's political crisis, the National Assembly tried to repeal the law that created the Orinoco Mining Arc and even labelled it ""ecocide"" or a crime against the environment.

We've asked three government ministries about the strategy to reduce deforestation in the zone, but none have responded.","In the last 10 years, figures for primary forest loss have remained high or spiked in most of the Amazon nations.
The Brazilian authorities are deploying troops in the Amazon region to help protect the rainforest, tackle illegal deforestation and forest fires.

Violence has erupted in cities across the US on the sixth night of protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd.

Curfews have been imposed in nearly 40 cities, but people have largely ignored them, leading to tense stand-offs.

Riot police clashed with protesters in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, firing tear gas and pepper bullets to try to disperse the crowds.

Police vehicles were set on fire and shops were looted in several cities.

The National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - said on Sunday that 5,000 of its personnel had been activated in 15 states and Washington, DC, where crowds once again gathered near the White House, this time lighting fires and throwing stones at riot officers.

""State and local law enforcement agencies remain responsible for security,"" the National Guard added.

It has emerged that in Friday night's unrest, President Donald Trump was briefly taken by the secret service into an underground bunker at the White House, for his safety.

The US is witnessing the most widespread racial turbulence and civil unrest since the violent backlash to the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968, says the BBC's Nick Bryant.

More than 75 cities have seen protests, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus, thronged with demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder.

The Floyd case has reignited anger over police killings of black Americans. For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died.

What's the latest on the protests?

There were many instances of police vehicles being vandalised and set alight on Sunday. Riot officers continued to respond with tear gas and flash grenades.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Stores were looted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

In Philadelphia, local TV stations showed people smashing police cars and looting at least one store.

Mr Trump tweeted: ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard.""

Looting was also reported in Santa Monica, California.

In Minneapolis, a lorry driver was arrested after reportedly breaching a road barrier before speeding towards a crowd of protesters marching along a major motorway.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption A tanker drives towards a crowd of protesters marching on a highway in Minneapolis, Minnesota

Footage posted on social media showed dozens of people surrounding the vehicle and pulling the driver out from behind the wheel after it came to a stop.

The driver was later taken to hospital with minor injuries. There were no immediate reports of other casualties.

Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said the motive of the driver was unclear, adding: ""To not have tragedy and many deaths is simply an amazing thing.""

In Denver, thousands of people protested peacefully in Colorado State Capitol by lying face down with their hands behind their backs and chanting: ""I can't breathe"" - a reference to the circumstances of Mr Floyd's death.

Large-scale protests also took place in Atlanta, Boston, Miami and Oklahoma City.

There were also several reported incidents of riot police responding disproportionately to the demonstrators. In Atlanta, Georgia, two officers were sacked on Sunday for using excessive force - including firing a taser - on two young college students.

A white ex-policeman has been charged with murdering Mr Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis.

Derek Chauvin, 44, is due to appear in court later on Monday.

It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement.

For three years, Donald Trump presided over a nation of relative peace and prosperity. The crises he faced were largely of his own making, and he confronted them by rallying his supporters and condemning his opponents.

Now Trump faces a situation ill-suited to a playbook of division. The US economy has been hobbled by a deadly pandemic. George Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has spread racial unrest across the nation. The public is uncertain and afraid - and increasingly angry.

These are circumstances that would test the abilities of even the most skilful leaders. This president, however, risks becoming lost at sea. His public calls for unity and healing have been undermined by a penchant for Twitter name-calling and bellicosity. Message discipline, a valuable attribute at this moment, is not his forte.

There may be no easy way to guide the nation through its current peril. Barack Obama's measured coolness did nothing to stop the fires of Ferguson any more than Richard Nixon's law-and-order edicts quelled Vietnam-era unrest.

The economic and social devastation of the pandemic has created a political landscape of dry brush ignited by the lightning strike of Floyd's death. The president may not be able to contain the wildfire, even if he isn't feeding the flames.

What happened to George Floyd?

On the evening of Monday 25 May, police received a phone call from a neighbourhood grocery store alleging that George Floyd had paid with a counterfeit $20 note.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A memorial to George Floyd near the spot where he died while in police custody in Minneapolis

Officers were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic.

According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started.

With Mr Chauvin's knee on his neck, Mr Floyd can be heard saying ""please, I can't breathe"" and ""don't kill me"".

According to a preliminary autopsy by the county medical examiner, the police officer had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive.

Nearly two minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead around an hour later.

A lawyer for Mr Floyd's family has accused Mr Chauvin of ""premeditated murder"".","For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died.

The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.

George Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Footage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor.

Mr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.

The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far.

It began with a report of a fake $20 (£16.20) bill.

A report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.

Believing the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police.

Mr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC.

But Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.

In a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but ""he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that"", according to a transcript released by authorities.

The employee said the man appeared ""drunk"" and ""not in control of himself"", the transcript says.

Shortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.

After approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.

Mr Lane, prosecutors said, ""put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car"". Then Mr Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed"".

Once handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for ""passing counterfeit currency"".

It was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued.

At around 20:14, Mr Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic"", according to the report.

Mr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.

During this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd out of the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said.

He lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.

That's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last.

Mr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.

""I can't breathe,"" Mr Floyd said repeatedly, pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"".

For eight minutes and 46 seconds, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors' report says.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Derek Chauvin is due to appear in court in Minneapolis on Monday

About six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.

One of the other officers, JA Kueng, did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but ""couldn't find one"". Yet, the officers did not move.

At 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance.

He was pronounced dead around an hour later.

On the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.

Forgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.

""The way he died was senseless,"" Harris said. ""He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.""","The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes.

There is a big case of ""wait and see"" around sending children back to school, and that is what you hear from parents - who perhaps do not want to be the first to send their children back.

Most of the schools have been open throughout lockdown for the children of key workers and those who are vulnerable. The aim today is to take back in the youngest and oldest kids in primary schools.

But not every school is able to open its doors to more children today. There are councils around England that say their schools aren’t ready to do that yet.

It has been left to headteachers to manage this themselves. Unions estimate that only half of the kids eligible will return to take up their places today because of the worries of parents.

The practicalities of this are very difficult. We’ve seen schools have to reorganise the way they are laid out, the way people move around, introduce one-way systems, and reduce classes that would normally have taken 30 kids down in some instances to just five, to try and enforce social distancing on a group who may not always be able to manage it.","Most of the schools have been open throughout lockdown for the children of key workers and those who are vulnerable.

131,Hong Kong: Boris Johnson urged to form alliance over China security law,https://bbc.com/news/uk-52872131,[],"Image copyright AFP Image caption Beijing's proposed security law has sparked protests in Hong Kong

Seven former UK foreign secretaries have urged Boris Johnson to form a global alliance to coordinate the response to the China-Hong Kong crisis.

China is facing mounting criticism over a planned security law for Hong Kong which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would not turn a blind eye.

Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997 but under a unique agreement.

The former British colony enjoys some freedoms not seen in mainland China - and these are set out in a mini-constitution called the Basic Law.

But there are fears the proposed law, which has sparked a mass of anti-mainland protests in Hong Kong, could compromise some of the freedoms guaranteed by the Basic Law.

In their letter to the prime minister, the cross-party group of former cabinet ministers says the UK government must be seen to lead the international response, as many countries take their cue from Britain over its former colony.

Jeremy Hunt, David Miliband, Jack Straw, William Hague, Malcolm Rifkind, David Owen and Margaret Beckett all expressed their concern at what they call China's ""flagrant breach"" of Sino-British agreements by imposing tough national security laws on Hong Kong.

They urged Mr Johnson to set up an ""international contact group"" of allies to coordinate any joint action, similar to that set up in 1994 to try to end the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.

A Downing Street spokesman insisted the government was already playing a leading role with international partners in urging China to think again.

Mr Raab said the new security legislation ""very clearly violates"" the autonomy that is guaranteed under Chinese law as well as that in the 1997 agreement.

He confirmed the UK will allow those who hold British National (Overseas) passports to come to the UK and apply to study and work for an extendable 12-month period.

This will in turn ""provide a path to citizenship"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.

Mr Raab said up to three million people registered as a British national (overseas) in Hong Kong could be eligible for UK citizenship if China presses ahead with the law.

Meanwhile, the chairman of Commons foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, said the government must realise that China has a ""very, very authoritarian system of government"" and should rethink the partnership between the two.","Image copyright AFP Image caption Beijing's proposed security law has sparked protests in Hong KongSeven former UK foreign secretaries have urged Boris Johnson to form a global alliance to coordinate the response to the China-Hong Kong crisis.

US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have docked with, and entered, the International Space Station (ISS).

Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - attached to the bow section of the orbiting lab 422km above China.

After a wait for leak, pressure and temperature checks, the pair disembarked to join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS.

Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday.

Theirs is the first crew outing launched from American soil since the retirement of the US space agency (Nasa) shuttles nine years ago.

The mission marks the beginning of a new era in which Nasa will be purchasing transport services from the commercial sector. No more will it own and operate the American vehicles that run to and from the station.

This will be done exclusively by firms such as SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST) on Sunday, 19 hours after leaving the Kennedy Space Center atop a Falcon rocket also provided by SpaceX.

The docking was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach.

The doors between Dragon and the ISS were opened at 17:02 GMT (18:02 BST). When Hurley and Behnken floated through, they were met by ISS Commander and fellow Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.

""We're just happy to be here and Chris is going to put us work. And hopefully we will fit in and not mess too many things up,"" said Doug Hurley as he nursed a bruise picked up on his forehead.

Bob Behnken said the pair were well rested and ready for the tasks ahead.

""We did get probably a good seven hours or so (of sleep),"" he said in a radio link with mission control in Houston, Texas. ""The first night is always a little bit of a challenge, but the Dragon was a slick vehicle, and we had good air flow and so we had an excellent evening.

SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans.

Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers.

SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract, which will encompass six astronaut ""taxi"" flights, with the first of these likely to occur at the end of August.

Hurley's and Behnken's arrival at the ISS means they get to claim a Stars and Stripes flag placed on the platform by the members of the very last space shuttle mission in 2011.

The Atlantis orbiter's crew left this flag as an incentive to all those that came after them. The flag, which also flew on the very first shuttle flight in 1981, will now be returned to Earth to be given to the mission that next goes beyond Earth orbit.

Earlier, Hurley and Behnken named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it ""Endeavour"", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s.

It's somewhat uncertain how long Hurley and Behnken will stay at the ISS, but perhaps as much as four months.

In that time, they will become members of the current ISS Expedition 63 crew, taking part in the platform's everyday science and maintenance activities.

Chris Cassidy joked that because his new crewmates arrived on a Sunday, they had missed the cleaning chores that normally take place on a Saturday. ""We'll catch up next weekend,"" the commander said.

133,Coronavirus: The mystery of 'silent spreaders',https://bbc.com/news/uk-52840763,"['David Shukman', 'Science Editor']","As the crisis has unfolded, scientists have discovered more evidence about a strange and worrying feature of the coronavirus. While many people who become infected develop a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell, others have no symptoms at all and never realise they're carrying Covid-19.

Researchers say it's vital to understand how many are affected this way and whether ""silent spreaders"" are fuelling the pandemic.

When people gathered at a church in Singapore on 19 January, no-one could have realised that the event would have global implications for the spread of coronavirus. It was a Sunday and, as usual, one of the services was being conducted in Mandarin. Among the congregation at The Life Church and Missions, on the ground floor of an office building, was a couple, both aged 56, who'd arrived that morning from China.

As they took their seats, they seemed perfectly healthy so there was no reason to think they might be carrying the virus. At that time, a persistent cough was understood to be the most distinctive feature of Covid-19 and it was seen as the most likely way to transmit it. Having no symptoms of the disease should have meant having no chance of spreading it.

The couple left as soon as the service was over. But shortly afterwards, things took a turn for the worse, and in a wholly confusing way. The wife started to become ill on January 22, followed by her husband two days later. Because they had flown in from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, that was no big surprise.

But over the following week, three local people also came down with the disease for no obvious reason, leading to one of Singapore's first and most baffling coronavirus cases. Working out what had happened would lead to a new and disturbing insight into how the virus was so successfully finding new victims.

Mobilising 'disease detectives'

""We were extremely perplexed,"" says Dr Vernon Lee, head of communicable diseases at Singapore's Ministry of Health. ""People who didn't know one another somehow infected each other,"" while showing no sign of illness. This new batch of cases simply did not make sense, according to what was known about Covid-19 back then.

So Dr Lee and his fellow scientists, along with police officers and specialist disease trackers, launched an investigation, generating detailed maps showing who was where and when. This involved the very best of the process known as contact tracing - a version of which is getting under way now in the UK. It's seen as a vital system for tracking down everyone involved in an outbreak and helping to stamp it out, and Singapore is renowned for the skill and speed with which this is carried out.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Early in the pandemic, Singapore was seen as a shining example of how to tackle the virus

Amazingly, within a few days, investigators had spoken to no fewer than 191 members of the church and had found out that 142 of them had been there that Sunday. They quickly established that two of the Singaporeans who became infected had been at the same service as the Chinese couple.

""They could have spoken to each other, greeted each other, during the usual activities of a church service,"" says Dr Lee.

That was a useful start and would explain in theory how the infection could have been passed on, apart from one key factor. It did not answer the crucial question of how the virus could have been transmitted by the two Chinese people when at that stage they had shown no indication of having the disease.

And on top of that was an even greater puzzle. It was confirmed that the third Singaporean to become infected, a 52-year-old woman, had not been at the same service as the others. Instead she had attended another event in the same church later that day, so how could she have picked up the virus?

Evidence no-one expected

Investigators resorted to going through the CCTV recordings made at the church that Sunday to search for clues. And they stumbled across something completely unexpected - the woman who'd attended the later service, after the Chinese couple had left, had sat in the seats they had used several hours earlier.

Somehow, despite having no symptoms and not feeling ill, the Chinese husband and wife had managed to spread the virus. Maybe they'd had it on their hands and touched the seats, maybe their breath carried the infection and it landed on a surface, it's not clear, but the implications were huge.

For Dr Lee, piecing everything together, there was only one possible explanation - that the virus was being passed by people who had it without even realising. This was a revelation that would be relevant the world over because the central message of all public health advice on coronavirus has always been to look out for symptoms in yourself and others.

But if the virus was also being spread by people without symptoms, silently and invisibly, how could the disease be stopped? He remembers the moment, while working in his office, when the reality dawned on him. ""Every time you make a scientific discovery, it is like a 'eureka' moment when you realise that this is something important that you've uncovered, through the hard work of many individuals and teams.""

Spread before symptoms show

What was revealed was what's known as ""pre-symptomatic transmission"" where someone is unaware of being infected because the cough, fever and other classic symptoms have yet to begin.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Singapore saw a rise in cases after appearing to have the virus under control

Along with many others, this study highlighted a critical period of 24-to-48 hours before the visible onset of the disease in which people can be highly infectious, perhaps even their most infectious.

Being aware of that is potentially invaluable, because as soon as you realise you're ill then everyone you've been in close contact with can be warned to stay at home.

That would mean that they would be isolating during the key phase of infection before their own symptoms start. But exactly how the disease can be transmitted without a cough to project droplets containing the virus is still open to debate.

One option is that simply breathing or talking to someone can do the job. If the virus is reproducing in the upper respiratory tract at that time then it's possible that some of it will emerge with each exhalation. Anyone close enough, especially indoors, could easily pick it up.

And another potential form of transmission is by touch - the virus gets onto someone's hands and they touch another person or a door handle - or a seat in a church. Whatever the route, the virus is clearly exploiting the fact that people are bound to be less vigilant if they're not aware that they might be infected.

Some people never show symptoms

This is an even more mysterious scenario, and one that scientists simply have no definitive answer to. It's one thing to know that people can be infectious before their symptoms show, quite another when they become infected but never have any sign of it.

This is what's known as being ""asymptomatic"" because you are a carrier of the disease but do not suffer in any way yourself. The most famous case is that of an Irish woman who was working as a cook in New York at the beginning of the last century.

Image copyright Getty Images

Wherever Mary Mallon was employed, in house after house, people became ill with typhoid and at least three, maybe many more, died of it, but she was completely unaffected. Eventually a connection was established and it was confirmed that she was the unwitting spreader of the disease.

Reporters dubbed her ""Typhoid Mary"", a label she always resented, but the authorities took no chances and kept her in confinement for 23 years until her death in 1938.

Assumptions undermined

Staff nurse Amelia Powell was shocked when she found out that she is asymptomatic. She was at work on her hospital ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in April when a doctor rang to give her the result of a swab test.

She had been feeling normal and safe behind the personal protective equipment she had to wear while caring for patients with Covid-19. But suddenly all those assumptions were undermined because, to her horror, she had tested positive.

""It was a bit like hearing that someone in the family had passed, it was surreal. ""I thought, 'This can't be right, not me, I'm absolutely fine,'"" says 23-year-old Amelia.

She had to leave her post straightaway to go into isolation at home.

""I was worried because I've seen the other side, with patients deteriorating very quickly with it, so I did wonder if this would happen to me."" But, to her surprise, at no point did she feel unwell. ""I had nothing, literally - I was exercising indoors, eating normally, sleeping normally.""

At the moment it's impossible to know how many cases of infection exist but remain hidden from view.

The discovery that Amelia was infected was only revealed because she was part of a study of all the staff at her hospital. It produced the surprising result that as many as 3% of more than 1,000 people were positive while showing no symptoms at the time of the test.

An even greater proportion of asymptomatic cases was found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which had been sailing off the coast of Japan earlier this year. Later branded ""a petri dish for infection"", it had around 700 cases.

Researchers found that three quarters of the people who had tested positive had no symptoms.

And at a care home in Washington state more than half the residents were positive but had no sign of the illness.

'No single reliable study'

Different studies suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many cases are asymptomatic stretching from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects.

The upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"".

The risk of 'silent spreaders'

The biggest concern of Amelia, the nurse, was that she might have unwittingly transmitted the virus either to those she works with or to the patients who depend on her help.

""I don't think I passed it on because all the colleagues I work with tested negative but it was worrying to think how long I'd been positive for,"" she says. ""But we still don't know if people who are asymptomatic are contagious or not - it's very bizarre and the information about it at the moment is minimal.""

One study in China which found that the number of asymptomatic cases was actually greater than those with symptoms had a warning for the authorities. ""As 'silent spreaders',"" the scientists wrote, ""asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.""

Image copyright Getty Images

The team that studied that Diamond Princess reckoned that asymptomatic cases were likely to be less infectious than people with symptoms but even so they're estimated to have caused a significant number of cases.

The 'dark matter' of asymptomatic infection

To try to get an answer, scientists in Norwich are pushing for the population of the entire city to be tested.

""Asymptomatic cases may be the 'dark matter' of the epidemic,"" according to Prof Neil Hall, head of the Earlham Institute, a life science research centre, who's leading the initiative. Dark matter is the invisible substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe, and it's yet to be identified.

Prof Hall worries that asymptomatic cases may actually be driving the pandemic, keeping it going despite public health measures. ""If you have people who don't know they're ill while using public transport and health care facilities, inevitably that's going to increase transmission,"" he says.

""Any intervention that's only based on people coming to primary health care when they have symptoms will only deal with half the problem.""

A team of scientists in California believes that not knowing who's carrying the virus without symptoms is the ""Achilles Heel"" of the fight against the pandemic.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China launched a mass testing programme in Wuhan

In their view, the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to find out who's infected regardless of whether they think they are or not. That was also the recommendation of MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee in a letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

They wrote that the risk of asymptomatic transmission has ""a profound consequence for the management of the pandemic"". And they said that anyone looking after vulnerable people - such as health workers or care workers - should be given regular testing.

A similar approach is being adopted on a far larger scale in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic is thought to have begun.

As many as 6.5 million people there were tested in as little as nine days in a mass screening programme designed to detect the disease - including in those showing no symptoms.

Easing of lockdown

As lockdown measures are eased and more people start to use public transport, return to work or go shopping, getting to grips with the invisible risk matters more than ever. At the moment, there is no way of telling who among the growing crowds may be carrying the virus without knowing.

That's why governments the world over say it's essential that everyone cooperates with efforts to trace the contacts of anyone infected and then quickly self-isolates. They also advise that the best defence remains social distancing - to keep apart wherever you can. But where that isn't possible, the recommendation is to cover your face, even with a mask that's homemade.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More and more governments are advising wearing face masks

When the US government announced this policy, it highlighted the discoveries made in the church in Singapore back in January. The logic is that this is not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting others from you, in case you're infected but don't know it.

Many health professionals worry that masks might distract people from hand washing or social distancing, or increase the risk of contamination if they're clumsily handled. But more and more governments, most recently that of the UK, have become convinced of the benefits.

Not that face coverings will halt the pandemic on their own. But because there's still so little we know about asymptomatic transmission, almost anything is worth a try.

135,George Floyd death: Why do some protests turn violent?,https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52869563,"['Helier Cheung', 'Bbc News', 'Washington Dc']","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters took to the streets again on Saturday night

Curfews have been imposed in multiple cities in the US, after unrest and protests have spread across the country over the death of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody.

Most of the protests began peacefully - and several stayed peaceful. But in a large number of cases, demonstrators clashed with police, set police cars on fire, vandalised property or looted shops. The National Guard has activated 5,000 of its personnel across 15 states and Washington DC.

Experts have also drawn parallels with the 2011 England riots - when a peaceful protest over a man who was shot dead by police turned into four days of riots, with widespread looting and buildings set alight.

How do protests spread so quickly - and why do some become violent?

Protests spread when there's a shared identity

Image copyright AFP Image caption Many of the daytime protests were peaceful

Incidents like Mr Floyd's death can ""become a trigger moment because it symbolises a broader experience, amongst much larger numbers of people, about the relationship between police and the black community"", says Prof Clifford Stott, an expert in crowd behaviour and public order policing at Keele University.

Confrontations are particularly likely when there are structural inequalities, he adds.

Prof Stott studied the 2011 England riots extensively, and found that the riots there spread because protesters in different cities identified with each other - either because of their ethnicity, or because they shared a dislike of the police.

This meant that, when the police appeared to be overwhelmed, rioters in different districts felt empowered to mobilise.

How the police respond matters

Violent protests are less likely when police have a good relationship with the local community - but how they react to demonstrations on the day also matters, experts say.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Protesters squared off against police in Los Angeles on Saturday

""Riots are a product of interactions - largely to do with the nature of the way police treats crowds,"" says Prof Stott.

For example, he says, in a large crowd of protesters, tensions may begin with just a few people confronting the police.

However, ""police often react towards the crowd as a whole"" - and if people feel that the police use of force against them is unjustified, this increases their ""us versus them"" mentality.

This ""can change the way people feel about violence and confrontation - for example, they may start feeling that violence is legitimate given the circumstances.""

Darnell Hunt, dean of social sciences at UCLA, believes police in the US ""ramped up their aggressiveness"" over the weekend.

""Deploying the national guard, using rubber bullets, tear gas, and pepper spray - these are a range of police tactics that can exacerbate an already-tense situation.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Minneapolis voices: ‘As a black American I am terrified’

It's a pattern that has been seen in other protests around the world too. For example, in 2019, Hong Kong saw seven months of anti-government protests, that began as mostly peaceful and ended up increasingly violent.

Experts highlight a series of police tactics that were seen as heavy-handed - including the firing of large amounts of tear gas at young protesters - as moves that galvanised protesters and made them more confrontational.

Prof Stott argues that police forces that have invested in de-escalation training are more likely to avoid violence at protests. He points to protests that were able to stay peaceful in the US over the weekend - such as in Camden, New Jersey, where officers joined the residents in a march against racism.

It also depends on what's at stake

Moral psychology can help explain why some protests turn violent, says Marloon Moojiman, an assistant professor in organisational behaviour at Rice University.

A person's sense of morality is central to how they see themselves, so ""when we see something as immoral, it creates strong feelings, because we feel our understanding of morality has to be protected"".

""This can override other concerns people have about keeping peace"", because ""if you think the system is broken, you're going to want to really do something drastic to show that that's not acceptable.""

This can apply to a wide range of beliefs - for example, in an extreme case, someone who thinks abortion is a moral outrage may be more likely to say it's OK to bomb an abortion clinic, he says.

Research suggests that social media echo chambers could also make people more susceptible to endorsing violence, if they believe that their peers have the same moral views as them, he adds.

Looting and vandalism can be more targeted than you think

In the US, hundreds of businesses have been damaged, and there has been widespread looting in LA and Minneapolis over the weekend.

However, Prof Stott warns that while it's easy to assume that riots and crowds are ""irrational and chaotic, none of that is true - it's highly structured and meaningful for the people taking part"".

""To some extent, looting is an expression of power - black citizens may have felt disempowered in relation to the police - but in the context of a riot, the rioters momentarily become more powerful than the police.""

Studies of previous riots show that places that get looted are often related to big businesses, and that looting ""often relates to the sense of inequality related to living in capitalistic economies"", he says.

Image copyright AFP Image caption An Apple Store in Los Angeles was among those looted

Prof Hunt has studied the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which were sparked after four white police officers were acquitted over the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King.

He says there is ""a long history of targeting, or selectivity"", in vandalism and looting. ""In the LA uprisings, you'd often see 'minority owned' spray painted on minority businesses, so that people would bypass those.""

However, both Prof Stott and Prof Hunt caution that looting is complicated - especially as lots of people with different motivations take part, including people in poverty, or organised criminals.

The idea that violent protests are targeted and meaningful events to those taking part can also explain why looting occurs in some protests, but not others.

In Hong Kong for example, protesters smashed shop windows, threw petrol bombs at police, and defaced the national emblem - but there was no looting.

Lawrence Ho, a specialist in policing and public order management at the Education University of Hong Kong, believes this is because those protests were triggered by political developments and anger at the police, rather than discrimination and social inequality.

""Vandalism was targeted at stores seen to have a strong connection to mainland China,"" says Dr Ho. ""It was a deliberate attempt to convey a message.""

How can violence be prevented?

Public order experts say that for the police, being seen as legitimate and able to engage protesters in dialogue is key.

""Good policing tries to avoid an 'us' and 'them' mentality, and also tries to avoid the sense that police can act in ways that people see as illegitimate,"" says Prof Stott.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police cars, including in New York, were set on fire

Dr Ho also believes that negotiation is the best way - but points out that ""one of the hardest things today is that a lot of protests are leaderless. If you can't find the leader, you can't negotiate with them.""

More generally, he adds, politicians can make matters better - or worse - based on their approach to dialogue, and whether they use emergency legislation.

Ultimately, however, riots can be a symptom of deep-seated tensions and complicated issues that don't have an easy solution.

Prof Hunt says this week's US riots are the most serious ones since 1968 - after Martin Luther King was assassinated.

""You can't think about police brutality, and the profiling of certain communities, without thinking about the inequalities that exist in society and fuel those concerns,"" he says.

136,A cluster of islands: How Shetland locked down early and stopped the virus in its tracks,https://bbc.com/news/stories-52823510,"['Jon Kelly', 'Bbc Stories']","Image copyright Getty Images

Early in the Covid-19 outbreak, the Shetland Islands were one of the worst-hit areas of the UK by head of population. Now, no new cases have been detected there for six weeks. Some experts say it offers the rest of the country a route map out of lockdown - but for the first family on the islands to test positive, it hasn't been easy.

It was a clear, bright Tuesday in early March when the plane began its descent. The Shetland archipelago stretched out ahead of the tiny twin-propeller aircraft. Iain Malcolmson looked through his passenger-seat window at the sprawl of islands, aware of how far north he'd just travelled.

Iain, 53, an architect, was on his way home. He and his wife, Suzanne, had spent a long weekend in the Italian city of Naples with four friends. They'd hesitated before setting off on 28 February - news bulletins were full of alarming footage of the Covid-19 cluster in Lombardy, 500 miles to the north of where they were staying.

Image copyright Iain Malcolmson

But official travel advice at that point was clear - it was safe to visit the south of the country - so they'd gone as planned. All the same, Iain recalled spending the trip fastidiously wiping down restaurant tables and washing his hands.

Now, after an overnight stop in Edinburgh, Iain would soon be back at the house in the tiny settlement of Nesting, about 12 miles north of the islands' capital, Lerwick. Locals call this leg of the journey the ""white-knuckle express""; in strong winds, the plane has to take off and land at Sumburgh Airport sideways, like a crab. Normally, Iain preferred the 14-hour overnight ferry from Aberdeen. But on this occasion everything seemed calm.

During the first week of March 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic that had raged out of Wuhan still seemed far away. Here in the tiny aeroplane, Scotland's mainland was 110 miles to the south, Norway was 190 miles to the east. It was still possible to conceive that Shetland might be spared.

""You have to understand what Shetland is like,"" says Iain. ""We're pretty isolated, and I think most people thought it would be something that would happen to other people. It wouldn't have come to Shetland.""

Then, two days after he landed, on the evening of Thursday 5 March, Iain noticed he had a headache.

From Sumburgh Head in the south to Out Stack, the northernmost point in the British Isles, Shetland has 567 sq miles of land and 1,679 miles of coastline. Of its 100-odd islands, 16 are inhabited, and about half the 23,000 population, like Iain and his family, live close to Lerwick. In the summer, days are up to 19 hours long; in the winter, if you're lucky, you can see the Northern Lights.

The islands were pledged to Scotland by Norway in 1468, and the Norn language - a form of Old Norse spoken on the islands - died out in the mid-19th Century. The Scandinavian influence is still strong, from the Nordic-derived placenames - Burravoe, Grutness, Mavis Grind - to the brightly coloured timber-clad houses dotted across the landscape, and the annual Up Helly Aa fire festivals, which conclude with the torching of a Viking galley.

But despite this Shetlanders don't want the rest of Scotland to forget about them. A 2018 law introduced by the islands' Member of the Scottish Parliament banned public bodies from producing maps that depict Shetland, for reasons of cartographical convenience, in a box in the Moray Firth or east of Orkney rather than its true geographical location.

Iain was raised as a Shetlander. He left to study architecture in Edinburgh, where he met Suzanne, but two decades later, after starting a family, they decided to open a practice back on Shetland. It had been their dream for a long time.

""It's just the freedom that you have,"" he says. ""You've got family, friends and that sort of thing. It's a very friendly, positive sort of place."" He's a well-known figure in Shetland - he sits on the local community council, is a keen Up Helly Aa participant and has played guitar in local bands. The property he and Suzanne designed for their family to the dimensions of a Norse longhouse was featured on the BBC's Scotland's Home of the Year programme.

Shetland might be remote, but it is no backwater.

Thanks in part to the discovery of North Sea oil in the late 20th Century, its per capita GDP is among the highest of all Scotland's local authority areas. In the 1970s, the local council drove an extraordinarily hard bargain with the energy companies who wanted to operate the terminal at Sullum Voe. Compensation payments were invested in a charitable trust that ensures the islands have exceptionally good public services. ""The facilities up here are second to none,"" says Iain. ""Every little community has its own leisure centre or pool.""

When he woke on the morning of Friday 6 March, Iain still didn't feel well. For the past two days he'd gone in to work, but now he clearly wasn't up to it. One of the friends he'd travelled to Naples with, a Glasgow resident, wasn't feeling great either and had been advised by the NHS to get tested; so Iain and Suzanne arranged to be tested too.

Nurses arrived at the couple's house. They stripped off on the porch and, before stepping inside, changed into full PPE - visors, protective suits - before taking swabs from the Malcomsons' noses and the backs of their throats.

""It was like something off the telly,"" Iain says. The whole scenario was unnerving, but the staff were reassuring. ""They were saying: 'You'll be fine, the chances of you having it where you've been are almost zero. So don't worry about it.'"" He says he and Suzanne stayed indoors that weekend anyway.

There was a delay while the samples were tested - Iain was told they had to be flown down to Aberdeen and then taken to Glasgow. On Sunday evening the results came through: Shetland had its first confirmed cases of Covid-19.

""Everybody was gobsmacked,"" says Iain. ""And it all kicked off from there.""

At least one person on Shetland wasn't surprised by the arrival of the virus. His name is Michael Dickson.

Not long before, as NHS Shetland's chief executive, he'd been summoned to the mainland for a presentation on the likely impact of the pandemic. ""I can honestly say when I came out of the government briefing, it was without a doubt the worst day of my entire career,"" he says. ""To go back to Shetland and have to share that with the people of Shetland was incredibly difficult.""

He also knew that Shetland's geographical isolation would make treating the virus there especially challenging. ""Lovely as it is,"" he says, Lerwick's Gilbert Bain Hospital ""was never built for this."" There is no intensive care unit anywhere on the islands. At that stage, any patients who became critically unwell would need to be flown to Aberdeen or elsewhere on the mainland in an enormous RAF Atlas military transport aircraft.

But Shetland would have advantages, too. Standing at his front door, ""I can cast my eye out and see no-one"", he says. ""There's houses but I'm not going to see anyone walking down the street. If I go for a five-mile run I might run into three or four people. It's just a completely different place to socially distance.""

Also, an outbreak of measles on the Aberdeen ferry meant NHS Shetland had very recent experience of carrying out contact tracing. ""That was hugely useful,"" he says. ""The fact is, knowing the geography of Shetland, the different communities, makes a huge difference.""

This was crucial, Dickson says, after the first positive test results came in. ""When that call went out from the Public Health teams to say we need to do this now, there wasn't a debate. People came in on their Sundays and said 'Right, let's start, let's get on with this.'""

The nurses in visors and PPE suits who came to test the Malcolmsons took the names of everyone they had come in contact with and tested them too.

According to Dr Susan Laidlaw, NHS Shetland's public health consultant, staff from other NHS departments were drafted in to phone contacts. ""We had a week of very long hours and intense work following up the contacts, identifying new cases and getting them tested and isolated,"" she says. ""Although difficult at the time, this did help to contain the initial outbreak.""

""Everybody at our work got it,"" Iain says. ""And everyone from our work's family ended up getting it."" Some had diarrhoea, others lost all sense of smell and taste. Others fared worse - Iain says the father of one of his employees had to be airlifted to Aberdeen. He would later make a full recovery.

While the contact tracers scrambled to identify how far the virus had spread, Iain's condition was getting worse. Suzanne's symptoms were cold-like, but his were more like the flu - a high temperature, shivering. There was talk of flying Iain, too, to Aberdeen. The prospect terrified him. ""I really didn't want to go off the island,"" he says.

After a few days, Iain's symptoms began to improve. But the knowledge he might have given the virus to others in less robust health weighed heavily on him. He was terrified he'd given it to his parents, both in their 80s. ""That stress was there, knowing that you could have given it to people who weren't going to be as lucky as you.""

And while he'd been feeling unwell, Iain hadn't felt much like looking at social media. He hadn't yet seen the rumours about him.

The virus spread quickly on Shetland. On 12 March, four days after Iain and Suzanne's test results came back, the number of confirmed cases announced in the local press rose from two to six; five days later, they stood at 15; by 19 March, they had risen again to 24.

These were not enormous numbers, but they were enough to ensure that Shetland had the highest number of Covid-19 patients in Scotland relative to its population, and one of the highest in the UK. ""I think we were top of the graph possibly in the world at one point,"" says Dickson.

As Dickson sees it, this early spike was, in part, testament to the efficiency of the contact tracing teams. A dedicated Covid ward had already been set aside at the hospital. But compared to Orkney and the Western Isles, which had largely been unaffected at that point, Shetland stood out - and Shetlanders were understandably anxious.

Dickson believes this was a crucial factor in containing the outbreak; it meant islanders were already taking social distancing seriously before controls on movements were enforced.

""It's a difficult thing to say, but I think having those cases early on enabled us to move possibly more quickly than had we not had cases until later on in the pandemic,"" he says.

""My family live down in Brighton and if you went down to the beach there a week before the lockdown occurred you wouldn't have known anything was different. In Shetland, things have been different pretty much from day one.""

As early as 11 and 12 March, two Up Helly Aa fire festivals - hugely important events in Shetland's social calendar - were called off, in response to appeals from the health board. The following day, while the Cheltenham Gold Cup was going ahead as planned 700 miles away, it was announced that nearly all Shetland's schools would close from 16 March - a week before the rest of the country.

Cafes, bars, restaurants and leisure centres were already shutting down across the islands long before the Scottish and Westminster government imposed their lockdowns, says Maggie Sandison, chief executive of the Shetland Islands Council.

""I think there's a really strong sense of community in Shetland,"" says Sandison. Naturally, islanders were anxious to do the right thing by their neighbours. But also, because such a high proportion of the population knew each other, ""people were aware that they may have come into contact with somebody who then became a positive case"" - and this in turn meant they knew to self-isolate.

Sandison says the early decision to close schools was taken in part because some teachers had been part of the contact tracing teams and were advised to stay home after coming into face-to-face contact with people who had tested positive. On a sparsely populated group of islands, this was enough to put a strain on staffing levels. At the same time, ""there was quite heightened anxiety from parents"" some of whom were keeping their children at home already.

Ferry operators also began preventing tourists and non-residents from travelling to the islands before nationwide restrictions were brought in. ""Because the transport links with the mainland were reduced early on, and the transport operators are only taking people who have essential reasons for travel, this has to some extent isolated the islands,"" says Laidlaw.

A weekly Covid-19 Facebook livestream hosted by Dickson would attract as many as 600 viewers at a time. And Shetland's community spirit wasn't just about locking down and staying vigilant.

When laundry staff at the hospital found they had a shortage of scrubs, a sewing pattern was posted on Facebook along with an appeal to turn any unwanted bedsheets into medical clothing. ""We had bags and bags of finished scrubs within days,"" says a personal assistant working for NHS Shetland, 38-year-old Lisa Grey, who oversaw the Shetland Scrubs project.

As well as bringing extra colour to the wards, superhero patterns on erstwhile children's duvet covers proved especially popular with medical staff.

""You can see it when you're flicking through Facebook - folk saying, 'If anyone needs shopping, I'm off tomorrow.' If anyone needs help, there will always be someone that'll help,"" Grey says.

With the rest of Scotland and the UK soon following Shetland's example in locking down, and many other Covid-19 clusters emerging around the UK, the islands felt less like an outlier. But as March turned to April the archipelago's cases kept rising, and before long it would report its first death.

Word had spread quickly around the islands that the Malcolmsons had been the first to test positive; Iain had never expected otherwise. ""One thing about Shetland is you have absolutely no anonymity,"" he says. ""People know you're the person that's brought it in.""

To Iain, it was understandable, in a perverse way, when rumours about his family began to circulate on social media. Their names hadn't been officially released, and ""in the absence of fact, people just make stuff up"", he says. ""That's never going to change. There's always a few idiots out there."" As he hadn't been looking at Facebook, it was news to him when friends got in touch to say the family was ""getting a serious amount of flak"".

According to the gossip, on the weekend he and his wife had been tested, ""we were everywhere - we were out on pub crawls, we were out at concerts,"" says Iain. ""That weekend we did everything in Shetland that everyone else was doing. And I don't know why, but they were totally convinced that they'd seen us there.""

It was bad enough when it was confined to Facebook. Then tabloid journalists began calling the house. Iain's friends and family were feeling the pressure. They urged him to go on Facebook and correct the record.

Iain really didn't want to do it. He wasn't a big social media person. What if it backfired? Might this not antagonise people further?

But something needed to be said. Late one evening, Iain sat down at his computer and began typing.

""After some of the hardest few days we have ever experienced, and it is only getting harder, it is with a heavy heart that Suzanne and I feel it is necessary to put straight some of the more vicious rumours that are circulating about us on social media in Shetland,"" he wrote. After being told they were to be tested and advised to self-isolate, ""we have not left the house since and have not been out partying, or socialising of any kind"".

The response was overwhelmingly positive. The post was shared over 1,000 times; friends and neighbours backed up their account; the record was duly corrected. Iain didn't bear a grudge - this was what happened in the absence of reliable information. ""It showed you the good side and the bad side of social media.""

According to National Records of Scotland (NRS), the first death of a person in Shetland with Covid-19 took place some time between 30 March and 5 April. Five more came the following week; a sixth the week after that. On 6 May, another death was announced; there have been no more since then. Tragically, five of the seven were in a single care home.

Shetland has good reason to hope it has seen its last coronavirus death of the current peak. The last time a resident of the islands tested positive was 20 April - since then, the total number of confirmed cases has stood still at 54. Nine days afterwards, Dickson told Shetland's local media that the outbreak there may have ""plateaued"".

""They've obviously managed to control the virus by doing an early lockdown,"" says Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, who has advised the Scottish and UK governments. ""Full marks to them, really. Whatever they did worked.""

Shetland's isolation and lack of new cases makes it, along with Orkney, effectively ""a very small-scale New Zealand"", says Prof Pennington - and like New Zealand, he says, the islands could in theory lift their lockdowns by strictly controlling who comes and goes.

But the islands' authorities are cool on the idea of a New Zealand-style quarantine. Dickson notes how many patients have to travel to Aberdeen for routine, non-Covid medical treatment: ""So are we saying those people aren't able to go to the mainland because we've closed our borders?"" It's also necessary for the fishing and oil industries for some people to have the ability to travel in and out.

It's not just winter and spring events like the Up Helly Aa festivals that have been postponed though, as a result of the lockdown. In 2020 the long summer days will pass on the islands without sheepdog trials, the accordion and fiddle festival, Shetland Wool Week. And there's no end in sight - the first fire festival of 2021 has already been cancelled.

The absence of tourists is also being keenly felt.

""My business wouldn't exist without tourism,"" says Lynn Johnson, who runs the Cake Fridge tea room on a single-track road between Voe and Aith on West Shetland Mainland's northern coast.

To keep it going, she needs both the lockdown to be lifted and travel to resume. ""We really, really need that spring, summer, along with the big tourism boost that our islands get, to see us through the winter. And we're not going to have that at all.""

But for now, the lockdown is holding.

Shetland is ready to resume contact tracing - which was halted in late March, as in the rest of the UK - and Laidlaw says the islands are well prepared for the next phase. Since late April, Shetland has had its own Covid-19 testing equipment, meaning samples no longer have to be sent to the mainland. And two small planes - like the one Iain flew back from holiday on - have been converted into air ambulances.

In spite of the apparent success of Shetland's track-and-trace operation, no-one may ever know how the virus arrived there. Iain and his wife may have been the first people on Shetland to have tested positive, but that doesn't mean they were the first to bring it.

""Obviously I know about the contact tracing, the Malcomsons and their experience,"" says Dickson. ""We picked up those people who were diagnosed and got a positive result. I always say, those are the ones we know about. Shetland is a small community but we do have people who come in and out of the islands frequently.""

The couple most likely travelled in with the virus, but ""what we can't guarantee is they were the only people"". And there is no guarantee the Malcolmsons caught the virus in Italy either, as it is thought to have been circulating in Edinburgh, where they changed flights, since February.

Iain knows better than most the importance of social distancing. And he knows he's fortunate to being doing so in Shetland, where keeping apart from others is easier.

""It's absolutely beautiful,"" he says. ""You feel like you're on holiday. You have to be pretty disciplined about actually working. But this could be our summer, so you have to make hay while the sun shines.""

But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?”

The pricing equation

Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.”

This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.”

The art, meanwhile, comes from “the airline’s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That’s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,” Cany concludes.

But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving.

When will demand return?

In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.","Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends.

The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.”

The art, meanwhile, comes from “the airline’s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That’s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,” Cany concludes.

But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving.

When will demand return?

In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.","Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends.
This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket.
The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.”This is both a science and an art.

197,The surprising perks of isolated work,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200527-the-surprising-perks-of-isolated-work,['Norman Miller'],"For millions of people worldwide, widespread lockdown has cast isolation as a negative – a loss of group engagement and communal hubbub. Yet while many of us are clamouring to get back into the social rhythm of the office, there are people around the world who choose work lives involving long periods isolated in remote settings.

“Some people thrive on their own company,” says Sandi Mann, senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire. “It gives the freedom of not having to worry about other people in terms of their needs or judgements. Others might like the challenge to see if they can cope on their own or to help them adjust to a different pace of life.”

Mann sees solitary times as beneficial contrasts to the pace of modern living. “We get used to high levels of dopamine from a busy, hectic and stimulation-rich environment, but dopamine is addictive. So, to wean ourselves off we need lower levels of stimulation.”

Or perhaps, rather than thinking in terms of lower levels of stimulation, those who choose to spend time out in the world in solitary are actually discovering different kinds of stimulation that crowded lives cover up.

BBC Worklife talked to some of these workers out on their own and asked why they like their isolated jobs. For them, being alone need not mean being lonely – even in the remotest of places.

We want to visit our favourite pubs, theatres or shops, and we suddenly feel an odd nostalgia for taking the train, trying on new clothes or even shaking hands.

But as mandatory lockdowns around the world start to ease and businesses slowly open their doors, many of us who are not healthcare providers or essential workers are facing a puzzling dilemma: we feel anxious about resuming our normal routines, even though they’re precisely what we’ve been looking forward to.

We can’t predict exactly how our workplaces and commutes will change to combat coronavirus risks. Still, as we gear up to resume life outside the home, understanding the causes behind our apprehension is key to successfully managing the transition when the time finally comes.

204,The benefits isolation can have on your work,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200513-the-benefits-isolation-can-have-on-your-work,['David Robson'],"If you – like many people across the world – are now working remotely, you might be worrying about loss of facetime with your team. Remote collaboration tools might help us to make up for this by allowing regular communication throughout the working day – and it would seem to make sense to take advantage of that connectivity with constant updates about your progress.

Yet the latest psychological literature suggests that less communication might actually be more: constant collaboration can in fact reduce ‘collective intelligence’ (a team’s joint problem-solving ability). Instead of always staying in touch with colleagues with continual chats on Slack, say, we should aim to concentrate group communication to short, intermittent bursts – a single daily video call, for example – to boost team problem solving and creativity.

Besides helping us to make better use of our time during the current crisis, these findings could help to shape the ways that we go about team decision making in the future. Even if we are in the office, we might all benefit from having a bit more me time and a bit less team time.

Jumping to conclusions

This new understanding of group communication has been years in the making. Jesse Shore at Boston University kicked things off in 2015, with a study that explored the role of people’s connectivity during group problem solving. Put simply, is it useful for everyone to be talking to everyone else, so we all know what’s going in in every part of the team? Or is it sometimes better to limit our communication to just a few individuals?

Shore and his colleagues set up 51 groups, each consisting of 16 people. They asked the groups to play an online whodunnit game, borrowed from one of the US Department of Defense’s R&D teams, in which participants find and piece together clues to discover to predict the who, what, where and when of a (fictional) terrorist attack.","If you – like many people across the world – are now working remotely, you might be worrying about loss of facetime with your team.

205,Can the ‘Centenarian Olympics’ help you live longer?,https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20200520-can-the-centenarian-olympics-help-you-live-longer,['Alexander Villegas'],"Attia came up with a list of 18 things he wanted to do when he turned 100. He then chose exercises, like a 30-pound goblet squat, to mimic those activities and called them his “Centenarian Olympics.” Attia’s ‘events’ replicate everyday tasks like carrying groceries up flights of stairs, putting a suitcase in an overhead bin and getting off the floor with a single point of support – all things that Attia believes will help him prepare to live the life he wants to at 100. Even though the events comprise ability a young athlete might for granted, they’re challenges for a century-old body.

That’s why Attia wants to start practising now.

‘Never too late’

Of course, not everyone lives for a century.

“Despite all the preparation and trying to prevent diseases, there’s no guarantee to reach 100,” says George Leeson, the director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing. But, he adds, strength is key to staying physically independent later in life. “The research would suggest that even minor improvements in muscular strength will let us maintain independence and strength and push back frailty and instability in a person.”

As we age, our bodies start to lose muscle mass and bone density. Research shows that people can lose up to 5% of their muscle mass every decade after the age of 30. Lost muscle mass can be regained through training, and Leeson says studies have shown men tend to retain more muscle mass than women. The solution is to stay active, build muscle as early as possible and focus on maintaining it.

“Ideally from birth, we should prepare to live to 100,” says Leeson. “Of course, the earlier one starts to maintain muscle mass, the stronger one will be later in life and the easier it will be to maintain. But it’s never too late to start.”

Still, even though the body changes are gradual, there are harsh moments when people realise they can’t do things they easily did when they were younger. For Wilder, this moment came on when she was doing one of things she loves most, travelling. “I was having a hard time lifting a suitcase into an overhead rack, and realised that’s a disability. The inability to do something I used to do,” says Wilder. “Disability sneaks up on people.”","Attia came up with a list of 18 things he wanted to do when he turned 100.

It’s a very unstable and insecure time now anyway and losing control over my account right now makes me even more insecure.”

Following historical precedent, Germans appear to be responding to the current crisis by spending more carefully – and saving. Hauer says an internal bank survey found that 55% of Germans (taken from a sample of 10,000 people across the bank’s main markets) had “already changed their financial priorities for 2020”. About two-thirds of respondents said they were putting aside more money than before the crisis.

""When we opened, very few businesses in Neukölln were offering card payment,” Coulondre says.

It was just more simple for us and cheaper to start off like this.”

They started taking cards at the beginning of 2019. And, while they continue to accept cash, have seen more customers than ever pay by card during the pandemic – even regulars who always use cash. Yet, income is down. “At the moment we have as many card payments as on a regular day but sometimes half the revenue,” Coulondre says. Looking to the future, she anticipates an increase in card payments as the trend she's seen over the last two years continues.

Post-Covid: back to cash?



It’s hard to imagine cash regaining its former throne in German consumer life. In Hauer’s view, Covid-19 provided a nudge that society was ready for. “All this together helped drive a change in behaviour: the speed and magnitude of the change tells us that it wasn’t difficult to make, but people needed a strong reason to break an old habit.”

He says N26 believes that Covid-19 will “accelerate” the way to a future in which “cash payments are the exception rather than the norm”.

Typically, it would take her more than an hour to travel from her home in Astoria, Queens to her office at a management consultancy on Wall Street. It involved three modes of transport: a bus to drop off her baby daughter at day-care, then a packed subway carriage into Manhattan’s Financial District and finally a brisk 15-minute walk to the office.

“It just wasn’t fun,” she says. “It was awful.”

That was before the Covid-19 stay-at-home order stopped everyone in their tracks. Now, after several weeks of working from home, Loughney admits that she actually misses her commute. “It’s pitifully sad to say that, but it’s true,” she says. “Working from home – for those of us fortunate enough to be still working – has brought an added layer of stress. [The] need to always be on, to always be working. You’re working through dinner; you’re working after dinner; you’re working after you put your kids down to bed. There is no separation, and the commute provided that mental separation.”","Like many New Yorkers, Meg Loughney faced a stressful daily commute.

226,What makes Germans so orderly?,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200531-what-makes-germans-so-orderly,['Joe Baur'],"On the high-speed train gliding smoothly from Berlin to Düsseldorf, a young man started chatting to me. He eventually asked, “What are some of the cultural differences you’ve noticed between Germans and Americans?”

As if on cue, a middle-aged woman hovered over us and gave a harsh, “Shh!” with her finger pressed against her lips. She pointed to a sign of a mobile phone with a cross through it, indicating that we were in the Ruhebereich, the quiet carriage of the train.

“You must be quiet,” she said, before returning to her seat.

“That,” I said to the man sitting next to me. “That’s different.”

In the nearly four years I’ve lived in Germany, that woman’s reprimand was just one of many examples I’ve experienced of Germans strictly adhering to the rules in the name of preserving Ordnung (order). Because in Germany, as the famous expression goes, “Ordnung muss sein” (“there must be order”). In fact, this proverbial saying is so well-ingrained in the German psyche that it’s become a cultural cliché for Germans around the world, and a way of life for them at home.

This proverbial saying is so well-ingrained in the German psyche that it’s become a cultural cliché for Germans around the world, and a way of life for them at home

In Germany, your brown bottles must be recycled separately from your clear ones. You must be quiet after 22:00. You must always obey the red man at a crossing, even if no cars are coming. And if you want to get anything done in this country, you need to print and fill out the proper forms, make an appointment, take your number and wait to be called to find out if you followed the rules or missed something in the fine print – which you probably did.

On the surface, “Ordnung muss sein” seems to be the foundation of German personal and social conduct. But, stereotypes aside, is Germany really “orderly”?

As with many things “German”, the answer may go back to Martin Luther. In addition to forever changing how Germany (and the world) worships, many of the humble Reformationist’s personal preferences (from a love of beer to books to severe Bauhaus-inspiring design) have continued to shape German culture for the last 500 years. In fact, according to volume 67 of his Sämmtliche Werke text, it was the jowly monk himself who appears to have first written the earliest iteration of the expression.

'Ordnung' is in the water supply

Luther wrote, “Ordnung muss sein unter den Leuten” (literally: “There must be order among the people”). But Dr Wolfram Pyta, director of the Department of Modern History at the University of Stuttgart, contends that Luther wasn’t referring to the virtue highlighted in the contemporary use of “Ordnung muss sein”.

“Luther called for obedience to authority in his theological writings,” said Pyta. “But this isn't identical with … the expression ‘Ordnung muss sein’, which isn’t necessarily aimed at state order, but rather at order in one’s private life.”

While there's not much documentation of the phrase in the centuries after Luther, a 1930 article published in The New York Times claimed that Paul von Hindenburg, the last president of the Weimar Republic, had made the phrase “world famous”. The expression became further tied to German culture when Hindenburg graced the cover of TIME magazine in 1934 with the exclamation “Ordnung muss sein!” printed underneath his photo. The cover story, ""Germany: Crux of Crisis"", quotes Hindenburg shouting his “useful aphorism which serves him on all occasions” at Adolf Hitler while discussing politics.

“Order is considered to be a Prussian value on equal standing with fulfilling obligations, punctuality, hard work and honesty,” said Christina Röttgers, a German culture expert who helps international companies understand the German mindset to work with them effectively.

Order is considered to be a Prussian value on equal standing with fulfilling obligations, punctuality, hard work and honesty

Whatever the expression’s true origins, “Ordnung muss sein” is certainly embedded within the fabric of German society. But interestingly, Germans don’t discuss it, because according to Röttgers, the values and rules associated with it have already been internalised. Nobody needs to talk about the rules because it’s assumed everyone already knows them.

“Ordnung is in the water supply,” quipped Joachim Krüger, a German professor of psychology at Brown University. “Every child learns this saying in the context of cleaning their room,” added Röttgers. “For Germans themselves, it's part of their everyday lives, but they don't think about it any more than someone thinks about grammar while they’re speaking.""

Verena Netscher, a personnel consultant from Cologne, agreed. “I think it’s something that exists in the minds of people in Germany,” she said. “But I don’t think anyone is especially striving to achieve this ideal.”

Around the country, every German I asked agreed with Netscher’s sentiments. “There’s order and that’s a good thing,” Lukas Pietrek, a law student in Düsseldorf, wrote to me. “But a lot of people are nevertheless too orderly and stuffy.”

Needless to say, Ordnung has slipped into everyday German vocabulary. If you seem distraught, a passerby might ask, “Alles in Ordnung?”. In English, that’s, “Are you OK?”, but literally, they’re asking, “Is everything in order?”. If everything is as it should be, then you’re “in Ordnung”.

It’s also stitched on uniforms of the men and women who work for the Ordnungsamt (Germany’s Public Order Office). This is essentially a special police force that focuses on misdemeanours, which in Germany includes playing loud music during quiet hours, parking violations and enforcing when and how long your dog is allowed to bark (10 minutes at a time and no more than 30 minutes a day outside of quiet hours, according to a court decision). If you’re caught on the wrong side of the Ordnungsamt, you’ll get an Ordnungswidrigkeit – a misdemeanour.

Yet, whenever you mention “Ordnung muss sein”, Germans are quick to mention another expression, “Ordnung ist das halbe Leben” (“Order is half of life”). And when they tack on the rest of the expression, it turns Germans’ trademark tidiness on its head: “Unordnung die andere Hälfte” (“And disorder the other half”).

Nobody will deny that there are splashes of disorder in Germany. Commuters across the country burst onto trains before people have a chance to get out; people routinely vandalise rubbish bins bearing the word, “Ordnung!” on them; and the nation’s “newest” airport is finally set for take off in October after a nine-year delay due to design flaws, scandals and general chaos.

In fact, for more than 100 years – from the hedonistic parties of the Weimar Republic to the boho-squat raves before unification to the techno temples of today – my home of Berlin has been renowned around the world as an anything-goes lab of cultural experimentation. Nearly 20 years after the city’s former mayor called it “poor but sexy”, people from around the world still move here precisely to free themselves of rigid life plans and to be whoever and whatever they want without a judgmental glance.

But even in a city legendary for its libertine tolerance and anarchistic spirit, there are still strict, unwritten rules. Want to grab spray paint and tag part of the Berlin Wall? There’s a designated section of Mauerpark where you can do that. Want to go au natural? There are unmarked swaths of the city’s central Tiergarten park and surrounding lakes where clothing is severely frowned upon. And want to do drugs and have sex with strangers? No-one will bat an eye at most Berlin clubs – so long as you do your business in the right room.

Berlin may be a special beast, but the deeper you dive, the more you’ll see this carefree cultural attitude across Germany. Frankfurt has its growing Bahnhofsviertel neighbourhood full of brothels and clubs. Hamburg’s St Pauli area is one of Europe’s most raucous red-light districts. Even the most conservative corners of Bavaria and the former East Germany embrace the Freikörperkultur (free-body culture) of relaxing in the buff at certain campsites, beaches and resorts.

Of course, each of these examples still fits neatly within Germany’s specific sense of order: it’s less about banning certain things and more about making sure you’re doing them in the proper, assigned place. Chat softly on the quiet carriage of a train and you’re likely to get scolded. But drink a beer on Berlin’s subway and no-one will say a word because of another unwritten rule that public drinking – and even public transit drinking – is generally deemed acceptable.

""Most hold themselves to the rules because they've learned that the rules are reasonable,” explained Röttgers. “But everyone has their own interpretation of the rules because people are individuals.”

Of course, if you run afoul of someone’s interpretation of the rules, many strangers may gladly let you know that you’ve disrupted their Ordnung. “Germans aren't shy about pointing out when others break the rules,” said Röttgers. “Strangers will rebuke you because there’s an expectation that everyone will follow the rules.”

That explains why a neighbour of mine shared a video of how to properly deconstruct a cardboard box for the recycling bin in my apartment building’s WhatsApp chat. “In five seconds, a box is made small. If I can do it, you all can, too.” The message was signed with a kissy-face emoji.

But on the whole, German order is rather pragmatic. “Ordnung muss sein” doesn’t mean building a false reality. It means Germans demand that systems are in place to prevent the worst from happening, like Kurzarbeit (short work) – a programme that allows businesses to decrease the hours of their employees during times of crisis (like the 2008 financial crash and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic) and the government will pay 60% of the remaining salary to avoid mass unemployment.

Having travelled extensively through all of Germany’s 16 states, I have seen Ordnung operate swiftly and smoothly, from the Black Forest to the Baltic Sea. But I’ve also seen Germans throwing this order overboard at “acceptable” times – be it embracing their carnal core at Carnival, screaming at hordes of armoured guards at football matches or launching fireworks from crowded streets and balconies on New Year’s Eve.

In the end, Germany – like any country – is more than just one phrase.

“There are a lot of expressions that, when put together, build a picture of a culture,” Röttgers said. “‘Ordnung muss sein’ is just an excerpt.”

Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some cardboard boxes to “make small” and ensure my dog isn’t barking more than his daily allotted limit.

Of course, each of these examples still fits neatly within Germany’s specific sense of order: it’s less about banning certain things and more about making sure you’re doing them in the proper, assigned place. Chat softly on the quiet carriage of a train and you’re likely to get scolded. But drink a beer on Berlin’s subway and no-one will say a word because of another unwritten rule that public drinking – and even public transit drinking – is generally deemed acceptable.

""Most hold themselves to the rules because they've learned that the rules are reasonable,” explained Röttgers. “But everyone has their own interpretation of the rules because people are individuals.”

Of course, if you run afoul of someone’s interpretation of the rules, many strangers may gladly let you know that you’ve disrupted their Ordnung. “Germans aren't shy about pointing out when others break the rules,” said Röttgers. “Strangers will rebuke you because there’s an expectation that everyone will follow the rules.”

That explains why a neighbour of mine shared a video of how to properly deconstruct a cardboard box for the recycling bin in my apartment building’s WhatsApp chat. “In five seconds, a box is made small. If I can do it, you all can, too.” The message was signed with a kissy-face emoji.

But on the whole, German order is rather pragmatic. “Ordnung muss sein” doesn’t mean building a false reality. It means Germans demand that systems are in place to prevent the worst from happening, like Kurzarbeit (short work) – a programme that allows businesses to decrease the hours of their employees during times of crisis (like the 2008 financial crash and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic) and the government will pay 60% of the remaining salary to avoid mass unemployment.

Having travelled extensively through all of Germany’s 16 states, I have seen Ordnung operate swiftly and smoothly, from the Black Forest to the Baltic Sea. But I’ve also seen Germans throwing this order overboard at “acceptable” times – be it embracing their carnal core at Carnival, screaming at hordes of armoured guards at football matches or launching fireworks from crowded streets and balconies on New Year’s Eve.

In the end, Germany – like any country – is more than just one phrase.

“There are a lot of expressions that, when put together, build a picture of a culture,” Röttgers said. “‘Ordnung muss sein’ is just an excerpt.”

Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some cardboard boxes to “make small” and ensure my dog isn’t barking more than his daily allotted limit.

232,Spain’s mysterious mummies,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200528-the-guanches-spains-mysterious-mummies,"['Fernando Teixeira', 'Izabela Cardoso']","The Canary Islands’ subtropical climate, aquamarine waters and otherworldly volcanic and desert landscapes led more than 15 million people to visit the archipelago last year. The islands are considered the southernmost region of Spain, with their easternmost point located just 100km west of Morocco. But long before the first Spanish settlers arrived to the islands in the 1470s, another civilisation was already thriving there: the Guanches.

The Guanches’ origins have long been debated and speculated by archaeologists and historians. Some theorise they were descendants of the Celts, or perhaps the Vikings. Others believe they could even be descended from the mythical inhabitants of Atlantis. A 2019 study of the DNA from ancient mummies from the islands, however, revealed they were most likely Berbers from North Africa, who arrived there around 100AD or even earlier.

This media cannot be played on your device.

How exactly the Guanches reached the archipelago remains unclear. One theory suggests they crossed in small vessels, landing in the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. And although the number of settlers also remains a mystery, studies estimate that 14 couples would have been enough to populate the archipelago.

Archaeological studies suggest the Guanches were organised in a tribal society, where chieftains or kings ruled almost absolutely. They relied on farming, hunting and gathering, and their diet included milk, goat, pork and fruits. They mainly dressed in goat-skin leather tunics and vests made of plaited rushes and lived in caves or simple low-stone houses.

They adapted caves and grottoes to be used as silos and temples. Some of those structures have been preserved to this day and indicate the Guanches’ sophisticated astronomical knowledge: holes on the caves’ walls allowed sunlight in at certain positions during different times of the year, marking solstices and equinoxes.

One of the most noteworthy of those structures is Risco Caído, a settlement that consists of 21 caves excavated on a volcanic tuff about 100m high above the Barraco Hondo River in the island of Gran Canaria. The site is believed to have been used as a silo, a temple and a place for astronomical observation, with holes that allowed sunlight and moonlight to enter the caves and illuminate symbolic drawings on the walls. In 2019, Risco Caído became the first Unesco World Heritage site in the Canary Islands.

238,The tree that changed the world map,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200527-the-tree-that-changed-the-world-map,['Vittoria Traverso'],"Unfurling in a carpet of green where the Andes and Amazon basin meet in south-western Peru, Manú National Park is one of the most biodiverse corners of the planet: a lush, 1.5-million hectare Unesco-inscribed nature reserve wrapped in mist, covered in a chaos of vines and largely untouched by humans.

Where to see the rare cinchona tree Manú National Park, Peru: A haven of biodiversity, the Unesco nature preserve is home to an estimated 5,000 plant species. Podocarpus National Park, Ecuador: One of the last places to spot Ecuador’s national tree. Hiking through its misty trails, you may also encounter the spectacled bear, one of the Andes’ most emblematic animals. Cutervo National Park, Peru: Peru’s oldest protected area is famous for its pre-Columbian archaeological remains, 88 species of orchids and for being the last remaining cloud forest in the Peruvian highlands. Semilla Bendita Botanical Garden, Peru: This botanical garden operated by local environmentalists is home to more than 1,300 native species – including orchids and cinchonas.

But if you hack your way through the rainforest’s dense jungle, cross its rushing rivers and avoid the jaguars and pumas, you may see one of the few remaining specimens of the endangered cinchona officinalis tree. To the untrained eye, the thin, 15m-tall tree may blend into the thicketed maze. But the flowering plant, which is native to the Andean foothills, has inspired many myths and shaped human history for centuries.

“This may not be a well-known tree,” said Nataly Canales, who grew up in the Peruvian Amazonian region of Madre de Dios. “Yet, a compound extracted from this plant has saved millions of lives in human history.”

Today, Canales is a biologist at the National Museum of Denmark who is tracing the genetic history of cinchona. As she explained, it was the bark of this rare tree that gave the world quinine, the world’s first anti-malarial drug. And while the discovery of quinine was welcomed by the world with both excitement and suspicion hundreds of years ago, in recent weeks, this tree’s medical derivatives have been at the centre of another heated global debate. Synthetic versions of quinine – such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – have been touted and largely disputed as possible treatments for the novel coronavirus.

For centuries, malaria, a disease caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, has plagued people across the world. It ravaged the Roman Empire; it killed between 150 to 300 million people in the 20th Century; and, according to the World Health Organization, nearly half of the world’s population still lives in areas where the disease is transmitted.

Medieval remedies to cure “mal aria” (“bad air” in Italian) reflected the erroneous belief that it was an airborne disease and ranged from bloodletting to limb amputations to cutting a hole in the skull. But in the 17th Century, the first known cure for it was allegedly found here, deep in the Andes.

According to legend, quinine was discovered as a malaria cure in 1631 when the Countess of Cinchona, a Spanish noblewoman married to the viceroy of Peru, fell ill with a high fever and severe chills – the classic symptoms of malaria. Desperate to heal her, the viceroy gave his wife a concoction prepared by Jesuit priests made with the bark of an Andean tree and mixed with clove and rose-leaf syrups and other dried plants. The countess soon recovered and the miraculous plant that cured her was named “cinchona” in her honour. Today, it’s the national tree of Peru and Ecuador.

People across Europe began writing about a 'miraculous' malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World

Most historians now dispute this tale, but as with many legends, parts of it are true. Quinine, an alkaloid compound found in cinchona’s bark, can indeed kill the parasite that causes malaria. But it wasn’t discovered by Spanish Jesuits.

“Quinine was already known to the Quechua, the Cañari and the Chimú indigenous peoples that inhabited modern-day Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador before the arrival of the Spanish,” said Canales. “They were the ones that introduced the bark to Spanish Jesuits.” The Jesuits crushed the cinnamon-coloured bark into a thick, bitter powder that could be easily digested. The concoction came to be known as “Jesuits Powder”, and soon, people across Europe began writing about a “miraculous” malaria remedy discovered in the jungles of the New World. By the 1640s, Jesuits had established trade routes to transport cinchona bark throughout Europe.

In France, quinine was used to cure intermittent fevers of France’s King Louis XIV at the court of Versailles. In Rome, the powder was tested by the Pope’s private physician and distributed for free by the Jesuit priests to the public. But in Protestant England, the drug was met with some scepticism, as some doctors labelled the Catholic-promoted concoction a “papal poison”. Oliver Cromwell allegedly died of malarial complications after refusing “Jesuit Powder”. Nevertheless, by 1677, cinchona bark was first listed by the Royal College of Physicians in its London Pharmacopoeia as an official medicine used by English physicians to treat patients.

To fuel their cinchona craze, Europeans hired locals to find the precious “fever tree” in the rainforest, scrape its bark with a machete and take it to cargo ships awaiting in Peruvian ports. Increased demand for cinchona quickly led the Spanish to declare the Andes “the pharmacy of the world”, and as Canales explained, the cinchona tree soon become scarce.

Cinchona’s value soared during the 19th Century, when malaria was one of the greatest threats faced by European troops deployed in overseas colonies. According to Dr Rohan Deb Roy, author of Malarial Subjects, obtaining adequate supplies of quinine became a strategic advantage in the race for global domination, and cinchona bark turned into one of the world’s hottest commodities.

Quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major 'tools of imperialism' that powered the British Empire

“European soldiers engaged in colonial wars frequently died of malaria,” said Deb Roy. “Drugs like quinine enabled soldiers to survive in tropical colonies and win wars.”

As he explains, cinchona was especially used by the Dutch in Indonesia; by the French in Algeria; and most famously, by the British in India, Jamaica and across South-East Asia and West Africa. In fact, between 1848 and 1861, the British government spent the equivalent of £6.4m each year importing cinchona bark to store for its colonial troops. As a result, quinine is frequently cited by historians as one of the major “tools of imperialism” that powered the British Empire.

“Much like countries today are rushing to get to a Covid-19 vaccine to get a competitive advantage, countries back then rushed to get quinine” explained Patricia Schlagenhauf, a professor of travel medicine at the University of Zurich specialising in malaria.

Churchill allegedly said the drink had saved 'more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire'

It wasn’t just cinchona bark that was valuable. Its seeds become a high-demand commodity too. “British and Dutch governments wanted to plant cinchona in their own colonies to stop their dependence on South America,” Deb Roy explained. But choosing the right seed wasn’t easy. Each of the 23 species of cinchona has a different quinine content. It was thanks to locals with indigenous botanical knowledge that Europeans could secure quinine-rich species to export abroad.

By the mid-1850s, the British had successfully established “fever tree” plantations in southern India, where malaria was rampant. Soon, British authorities started distributing locally harvested quinine to soldiers and civil servants. It’s long been rumoured that they allegedly mixed gin with their quinine to make it more palatable, thus inventing the first tonic water and the famous gin and tonic drink. Today, small amounts of quinine are still found in tonic water. But as Kim Walker, who co-authored the book Just the Tonic points out, this British origin story is likely a myth. “It seems like they added whatever was handy” – be it rum, brandy or arrack, she explained.

Plus, as Schlagenhauf adds, quinine has a short lifespan in the body so sipping on a gin and tonic at cocktail hour would not be enough to guarantee protection against malaria. Nevertheless, the myth of gin and tonic as a potent anti-malaria prevention tricked even Winston Churchill, who allegedly said the drink had saved “more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire.”

Of course, the gin and tonic is just one drink tied to the “fever tree”. Today, the most famous cocktail in Peru may be the American-invented pisco sour, but the most popular among Peruvians is arguably the bitter, quinine-flavoured pisco tonic, a homegrown invention that’s often mixed with maiz morado (purple corn) from the Andes to make a pisco morada tonic. If you’ve ever sipped liqueurs like Campari, Pimm’s or the French aperitif Lillet (a key ingredient in James Bond’s famous Vesper martini), you’ve tasted quinine. It’s also found in Scotland’s “other” national drink, Irn-Bru, and in what is reported to be Queen Elizabeth II’s favourite drink, gin and Dubonnet – an aperitif which, coincidentally, was invented by a French chemist to make quinine more palatable for French troops stationed in North African colonies.

Quinine was eventually pushed aside in the 1970s by artemisinin, a drug derived from the sweet wormwood plant, as the world’s go-to malaria remedy. Still, the legacy of quinine runs deep around the world. Today, Ban-dung, Indonesia, is known as “The Paris of Java” because the Dutch transformed this once-sleepy port into the world’s largest quinine centre, brimming with Art Deco buildings, ballrooms and hotels. English is widely spoken in places as diverse as India, Hong Kong, Sierra Leone, Kenya and coastal Sri Lanka; and French in Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria today partly because of quinine. And in Spanish, there is still an expression that states, “ser más malo que la quina” – which roughly translates as, “to be worse than quinine”, a reference to the bark’s bitter taste.

At the height of the global “quinine hunt” in the 1850s, Peru and Bolivia both established monopolies over their highly lucrative tree bark exports. In fact, much of La Paz’s Neoclassical cathedral and many of the cobblestone streets running through the city’s plaza-filled historic centre today were built with cinchona bark, which at one point accounted for 15% of Bolivia’s total tax revenue.

However, the centuries-long demand for cinchona bark has left a visible scar on its native habitat. In 1805, explorers documented 25,000 cinchona trees in the Ecuadorean Andes. The same area, now part of the Podocarpus National Park, counts just 29 trees.

It is to plants that we owe some of the major medicinal breakthroughs in human history

Canales explained that the removal of quinine-rich species from the Andes has changed the genetic structure of cinchona plants, reducing their ability to evolve and change. Part of Canales’ work, in collaboration with the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew outside London, is to look at old cinchona bark specimens preserved in museums to study how human behaviour may have altered the plant. “We think that cinchona may have evolved to contain less quinine because of overharvesting,” she explained.

Recently, the World Health Organization halted studies of quinine’s synthetic descendant, hydroxychloroquine, as a possible coronavirus treatment amid safety concerns. Despite the fact that the drug is now developed in labs versus extracted from forests, Canales says the protection of the cinchona and the endangered “pharmacy of the world” that nurtures it, is crucial for the discovery of new drugs in the future.

In the absence of government protection of cinchona, local conservation groups are stepping in. Environmental organisation Semilla Bendita, literally “blessed seeds”, is planning to plant 2021 cinchona seeds for the 200th anniversary of Peru’s independence in 2021, and scientists like Schlagenhauf hope that more efforts to preserve the Andes’ biodiversity will follow.

“What the story of quinine shows is that biodiversity and human health go hand in hand,” Schlagenhauf said. “People often think of plant-based remedies as ‘alternative medicine’, but it is to plants that we owe some of the major medicinal breakthroughs in human history.

245,Cacio e pepe: Italy’s beloved three-ingredient pasta dish,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200512-cacio-e-pepe-italys-beloved-3-ingredient-pasta-dish,['Emily Monaco'],"Cacio e pepe is a dish of only three ingredients, two of which are evident at first glance to anyone familiar with Roman dialect. Cacio is Romanesco for sheep’s milk cheese. Along with pepe, or black pepper, the cheese – ideally Pecorino – unites with pasta (and a hefty dose of starchy cooking water) to form a rich, creamy sauce that is as delicious as it is difficult to perfect.

""[It's] as delicious as it is difficult to perfect.

According to legend, the dish first appeared centuries ago among shepherds spending the spring and summer months in the grazing meadows of the Apennine Mountains, which traverse the Italian peninsula. While keeping watch over their flocks, shepherds would tap into personal stores of dried pasta and pepper; cheap, easy to transport and resistant to spoilage, these two ingredients were combined with the cheese (made from milk of the herders’ flocks) to make a delicious, simple dish that kept them warm on cold evenings.

“Black pepper directly stimulates the heat receptors and helped the shepherds to protect themselves from the cold,” explained Alessandra Argiolas, marketing manager for Sardinian Pecorino producers Argiolas Formaggi. “And the pasta guaranteed a lot of energy.”

But according to Angelo Carotenuto, a native Roman and owner and manager of LivItaly Tours, cacio e pepe’s origin may be a bit less romantic. Carotenuto and local guide Dario Bartoli recently took to the internet with a LivTalk, “sort of like a TedTalk gone late-night show” as described by Carotenuto, to profile this and other local pasta dishes.

According to them, dishes like cacio e pepe, carbonara (a rich sauce made with a combination of beaten egg and dry-cured guanciale or pork cheek) and amatriciana (made with guanciale, tomato and Pecorino cheese) likely got their start, not in the mountains, but in the mines and factories that once surrounded the Lazio region encompassing Rome, near where low-income families once lived.

Dried cheese, dried guanciale and dried pasta were filling, cheap and didn’t spoil easily: perfect for a simple, inexpensive meal. And while the first two ingredients would likely have been used locally for “literally centuries,” according to Carotenuto, the invention of these dishes, now perceived as Roman classics, probably dates to the 1800s, when pasta became popular in the Italian capital.

“You’re looking at the unification of Italy, so the ability to transfer flavours and recipes easily,” he explained, noting that before unification, the poor would have been getting their carbohydrates from bread and polenta, rather than from pasta, which, Carotenuto explains, is said to have arrived in Italy through the Venetian ports.

However cacio e pepe was invented, one thing is for sure: it has captured many hearts around the world, including that of the late, great Anthony Bourdain. In one episode of No Reservations, Bourdain went so far as to say the dish “could be the greatest thing in the history of the world” – and refused to disclose his favourite cacio e pepe restaurant in Rome.

Cacio e pepe has journeyed far from its humble roots. It has been topped with shaved truffle at London’s Fucina; it has been an off-menu “secret” offering for VIPs at Washington DC’s Rose’s Luxury; and it has been prepared in a wheel of Pecorino and served in a tableside spectacle at New York City’s aptly named Cacio e Pepe restaurant. Closer to home in Rome, the dish has gone upscale, appearing on the three-Michelin-starred menu at La Pergola.

But despite its international acclaim and elevated status, at its core, cacio e pepe remains a stalwartly simple dish.

Like many Italian classics, the secret to its success is the purity of its ingredients. To deviate from its three-part formula is to risk angering a local.

“We’re pretty strict about how these things should taste,” said Carotenuto.

For starters, the pasta. Most make cacio e pepe with spaghetti, though the true traditional recipe calls for tonnarelli, a similar local noodle with a bit more chew thanks to the addition of egg.

“That’s what I would order if I was in a restaurant,” explained Elizabeth Minchilli, culinary tour guide and author of Eating Rome: Living the Good Life in the Eternal City. “If I was at home and couldn’t get that, I would probably go with spaghetti.”

Either way, a long noodle is crucial to achieving the perfect texture.

“You really want to coat every strand with the cheese, and the fat from the cheese, and the starch from the water,” said Minchilli. “It just makes stirring really fast easier.”

The next ingredient, pepe or black peppercorn, should be freshly crushed to release all of its aromas. Many chefs, including Filippo and Giovanni Rinaldi of London’s Mammafarina pasta pop-ups, “bloom” the pepper in the pan by toasting it slightly, making it even more flavourful.

And then, of course, there’s cacio, or as the Renaldis call it, “her majesty, Pecorino!”.

“Pecorino is very important because of the flavour and sapidity that this cheese brings to the dish,” they said, noting that either Pecorino Romano or Pecorino Sardo (from Sardinia) can be used.

While the Rinaldis say that, “it should be forbidden to make cacio e pepe without Pecorino”, some do deviate a bit from this norm by adding another, more familiar cheese: Parmesan.

From a historical perspective, it’s an unusual choice, explained Argiolas.

“Cacio e pepe is a recipe of the Roman tradition,” she said, noting that already in 48BC, Virgil was describing the nutritional properties of the local sheep’s milk cheese. Parmesan, which hails not from Rome but from Emilia Romagna, is milder, nuttier and sweeter – the root of an Alfredo sauce, which Carotenuto calls “cacio e pepe for the American sweet tooth”.

But despite tradition, Americans are not the only ones to sub subtler Parmesan for in-your-face Pecorino. Massimo Bottura popularised an all-Parmesan version in 2012, after the Emilia Romagna region was hit by a devastating earthquake. And other cooks, like Minchilli, will cut an especially strong piece of Pecorino with a bit of Parmesan, to mellow it.

“It’s not blasphemous to add some Parmesan cheese to the Pecorino,” said Carotenuto. “Pecorino is a very strong, salty cheese. The starchy water kind of slows that taste down, so in my opinion, you don’t need Parmesan cheese. But you certainly can, especially if you’re giving it to children.”

“If all you have is a good-quality Parmigiano,” echoed Minchilli, “the cacio e pepe police are not going to come and arrest you!”

“It’s pretty typical of an Italian dish where, behind this simplicity, hides a fairly complex technicity”

The ingredients for cacio e pepe may be simple, but the technique requires a bit of finesse to perfect, according to Simone Zanoni, chef of Le George Restaurant in Paris.

“It’s pretty typical of an Italian dish where, behind this simplicity, hides a fairly complex technicity.”

The technique, in this case, is to unite the starchy pasta cooking water with very finely grated cheese to create a rich sauce with no added cream.

“If you tell someone who lives in Rome that you put cream in cacio e pepe…” Zanoni chuckled, “he’ll jump on your head!”

Instead, one must patiently and slowly incorporate the starchy water reserved from cooking the pasta with the cheese and the pasta itself until a smooth emulsion forms.

“Everything has to be the right temperature when you add it together, otherwise you get this sort of plate of noodles with a clotted piece of cheese at the bottom,” said Minchilli. “And it’s just not what you’re dreaming of.”

When you do get that elusive texture, cacio e pepe becomes the ideal comfort food.

“Cacio e pepe is a challenge, but also a dish that’s hard not to love,” said Meryl Feinstein, founder of the Pasta Social Club in Austin, Texas. “It feels like an accomplishment – for me included – when that glossy, emulsified sauce emerges. Plus, it’s made with few ingredients, and many you likely already have in your kitchen, so it fits in well with the need for pantry-friendly recipes.”

The flavour profile of cacio e pepe has spawned dozens of iterations, from gnocchi to risotto to lasagne. There are versions that make life easier, like Rachael Ray’s ricotta-based cacio e pepe mac and cheese. There are versions that make it even more over-the-top, like David Chang’s recipe with house-fermented ceci (chickpeas) in place of cacio at Momofuku Nishi; or the “taco” of cacio e pepe pasta served in a crispy chicken cutlet at New York’s Noble Kitchen. Paris-based chef Taku Sekine of Paris’ Dersou and Cheval d’Or recently posted a cacio e pepe pizza on his Instagram feed, noting that it’s easy to make at home, as “the ingredients are often there”.

“You can make it whenever the spirit moves you, just like cacio e pepe,” he said. “Of course… you need to make the pizza dough.”

For Zanoni, however, merely combining Pecorino and pepper does not cacio e pepe make.

“We wouldn’t call cacio e pepe pizza ‘cacio e pepe…’ we’d call it ‘a pizza with cheese and pepper’,” he said. “There’s a vision of tradition that’s completely different, and abroad it has taken on a completely different vision than what we have in Italy.”

One thing is for sure: cacio e pepe has captured the attention of home cooks around the world, especially given current confinement protocols.

“It’s funny to see how pasta, which abroad has always been perceived as this easy-to-make dish, is changing,” said Zanoni, who often gets requests for a gourmet version of cacio e pepe from his one-Michelin-star kitchen in Paris. “People are starting to give it a gastronomic identity.”

And whether you’re going crazy with new-fangled versions or sticking to the classic, it’s a comfort food dish that tastes great.

“With confinement, we’re coming back to old issues: that we couldn’t always access fresh products, and so we had things that we could keep around for a long time,” said Zanoni. “What better than a hunk of Pecorino, spaghetti and a bit of pepper?”

Simone Zanoni’s Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe

Ingredients:

200g high-quality, artisanal spaghetti (Zanoni uses Neapolitan spaghetti)

4-7g wild black peppercorns (adjust to taste, depending on the assertiveness of the pepper)

160g Pecorino Romano, plus two pieces Pecorino rind

3l water seasoned with 15g of kosher salt

Instructions:

Prepare your mise en place (the French world for having all your ingredients prepped and measured) in advance. Crush the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle. (If you do not have a mortar and pestle, use the bottom of a saucepan to crush them on a chopping board.) Grate the Pecorino with a Microplane (grater).

Bring the water to a boil, season with the salt, and add the spaghetti. Stir gently at the beginning to keep the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

Meanwhile, toast ¾ of the pepper in a pan over low heat until aromatic, about 1 minute. Be careful not to burn the pepper. Remove the pan from the heat, and gently add 2 to 3 ladlefuls of starchy pasta water to the pepper. Bring to a boil. Add the cheese crusts and simmer.

When the spaghetti is half-cooked (after about six minutes), transfer it to the pan with the peppercorns and starchy pasta water, reserving the remaining cooking water. Transfer another ladleful of water to the pan. After a few more minutes, remove the Pecorino rinds, and place them in a non-stick pan over medium heat to toast on both sides. When nicely toasted, remove and set aside.

Meanwhile, continue cooking the spaghetti until two minutes before al dente (cooked “to the tooth” with a slight bite). Turn off the heat and allow the pasta to rest; there should be a bit of cooking water left in the pan.

After about a minute off the heat, begin adding the grated cheese to the pasta from above, shaking the pan all the while to coat evenly. Add cooking water as needed to help the sauce bind; the sauce will thicken as the pasta sets.

Serve the pasta in a warmed dish. Top with the remaining pepper and a little bit of freshly grated Pecorino. Finely slice the toasted Pecorino rinds and sprinkle on top.

246,Cacio e pepe: Italy’s beloved three-ingredient pasta dish,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200512-cacio-e-pepe-italys-beloved-3-ingredient-pasta-dish,['Emily Monaco'],"Cacio e pepe is a dish of only three ingredients, two of which are evident at first glance to anyone familiar with Roman dialect. Cacio is Romanesco for sheep’s milk cheese. Along with pepe, or black pepper, the cheese – ideally Pecorino – unites with pasta (and a hefty dose of starchy cooking water) to form a rich, creamy sauce that is as delicious as it is difficult to perfect.

""[It's] as delicious as it is difficult to perfect.

According to legend, the dish first appeared centuries ago among shepherds spending the spring and summer months in the grazing meadows of the Apennine Mountains, which traverse the Italian peninsula. While keeping watch over their flocks, shepherds would tap into personal stores of dried pasta and pepper; cheap, easy to transport and resistant to spoilage, these two ingredients were combined with the cheese (made from milk of the herders’ flocks) to make a delicious, simple dish that kept them warm on cold evenings.

“Black pepper directly stimulates the heat receptors and helped the shepherds to protect themselves from the cold,” explained Alessandra Argiolas, marketing manager for Sardinian Pecorino producers Argiolas Formaggi. “And the pasta guaranteed a lot of energy.”

But according to Angelo Carotenuto, a native Roman and owner and manager of LivItaly Tours, cacio e pepe’s origin may be a bit less romantic. Carotenuto and local guide Dario Bartoli recently took to the internet with a LivTalk, “sort of like a TedTalk gone late-night show” as described by Carotenuto, to profile this and other local pasta dishes.

According to them, dishes like cacio e pepe, carbonara (a rich sauce made with a combination of beaten egg and dry-cured guanciale or pork cheek) and amatriciana (made with guanciale, tomato and Pecorino cheese) likely got their start, not in the mountains, but in the mines and factories that once surrounded the Lazio region encompassing Rome, near where low-income families once lived.

Dried cheese, dried guanciale and dried pasta were filling, cheap and didn’t spoil easily: perfect for a simple, inexpensive meal. And while the first two ingredients would likely have been used locally for “literally centuries,” according to Carotenuto, the invention of these dishes, now perceived as Roman classics, probably dates to the 1800s, when pasta became popular in the Italian capital.

“You’re looking at the unification of Italy, so the ability to transfer flavours and recipes easily,” he explained, noting that before unification, the poor would have been getting their carbohydrates from bread and polenta, rather than from pasta, which, Carotenuto explains, is said to have arrived in Italy through the Venetian ports.

However cacio e pepe was invented, one thing is for sure: it has captured many hearts around the world, including that of the late, great Anthony Bourdain. In one episode of No Reservations, Bourdain went so far as to say the dish “could be the greatest thing in the history of the world” – and refused to disclose his favourite cacio e pepe restaurant in Rome.

Cacio e pepe has journeyed far from its humble roots. It has been topped with shaved truffle at London’s Fucina; it has been an off-menu “secret” offering for VIPs at Washington DC’s Rose’s Luxury; and it has been prepared in a wheel of Pecorino and served in a tableside spectacle at New York City’s aptly named Cacio e Pepe restaurant. Closer to home in Rome, the dish has gone upscale, appearing on the three-Michelin-starred menu at La Pergola.

But despite its international acclaim and elevated status, at its core, cacio e pepe remains a stalwartly simple dish.

Like many Italian classics, the secret to its success is the purity of its ingredients. To deviate from its three-part formula is to risk angering a local.

“We’re pretty strict about how these things should taste,” said Carotenuto.

For starters, the pasta. Most make cacio e pepe with spaghetti, though the true traditional recipe calls for tonnarelli, a similar local noodle with a bit more chew thanks to the addition of egg.

“That’s what I would order if I was in a restaurant,” explained Elizabeth Minchilli, culinary tour guide and author of Eating Rome: Living the Good Life in the Eternal City. “If I was at home and couldn’t get that, I would probably go with spaghetti.”

Either way, a long noodle is crucial to achieving the perfect texture.

“You really want to coat every strand with the cheese, and the fat from the cheese, and the starch from the water,” said Minchilli. “It just makes stirring really fast easier.”

The next ingredient, pepe or black peppercorn, should be freshly crushed to release all of its aromas. Many chefs, including Filippo and Giovanni Rinaldi of London’s Mammafarina pasta pop-ups, “bloom” the pepper in the pan by toasting it slightly, making it even more flavourful.

And then, of course, there’s cacio, or as the Renaldis call it, “her majesty, Pecorino!”.

247,The tiny ‘country’ between England and Scotland,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200504-the-tiny-country-between-england-and-scotland,['Kirsten Henton'],"Nowhere does a brooding winter sky quite like the west coast of Scotland. As I looked across the open estuary of the River Esk, pale yellow sunlight filtered through streaks of low-lying cloud, reflected in the mirror-like ribbons of water and ripples of sand exposed by the retreating tide. All around, fields dipped gently to flatten out along the shore of the channel, which snakes its way westwards to the Solway Firth. The lowland coastline, flanked by rolling hills, expands until the firth meets the Irish Sea, creating a natural break in the land between Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland and Cumbria in northern England.

Standing firm against a determined breeze, I was surveying the scene from what marks the south-western end of the border between Scotland and England. Peacefully admiring nature at work, it was hard to believe that this seemingly tranquil, rural landscape was once at the edge of one of Britain's most lawless, and for a time, bloodiest, regions: the area known as the Debatable Lands.

Today, this once troublesome region is a laidback, quiet part of the border where hardy animal breeds are reared and a sense of community reverberates among the long-established towns and villages. This lesser-visited corner of the UK is also where you can get close to the story of those who called the Debatable Lands home: feuding clans known as the Border Reivers. It’s a place where local histories and scant ruins linger among wooded valleys, fast-flowing rivers and open moorland that lend themselves to letting your imagination fill in some of the blanks of its much under-told story.

And what a fascinating tale it is. The Debatable Lands is believed to have been the last great territorial division in Britain. Here, from the 13th to the 16th Centuries, the region's clans plundered land and livestock and endless blood was shed. Straddling the border, the Debatable Lands flourished as a sort of anarchic no-man's land, not independent but too dangerous and lawless for either Scotland or England to be able – or want – to take control of.

You may also be interested in:

This was highlighted in a remarkable parliamentary decree issued by the governments of both countries in the mid-16th Century, some 300 years into the Debatable Lands’ story: “All Englishmen and Scottishmen are and shall be free to rob, burn, spoil, slay, murder and destroy, all and every such person and persons, their bodies, property, goods and livestock… without any redress to be made for same.”

While this decree was made into law, it was more of a legal “out” for England and Scotland. Neither side wanted the responsibility of dealing with the Debatable Lands; and as they could not agree on who owned it or how it was divided, neither could be held responsible for it, either. As Dr Anna Groundwater, principal curator, Renaissance and Early Modern History, National Museums Scotland, told me, “It was not a valuable piece of land, high ground and poor farming potential, so it was probably seen as not particularly worth fighting for or defending.”

It was also a small area, something that struck me as I examined the map while waiting for a much-needed warming tea in the Cinebar Kitchen in the Scottish town of Gretna. The Debatable Lands ran just more than eight miles across at its widest, and roughly 13 miles from the elevated north down to the sandy-flats of the south with Gretna at its south-western tip and around one-third of the area extending into northern England. Gretna also proved perfectly placed as a launching pad for my foray, only a short detour from the A7, the artery that connects Edinburgh and Carlisle and cuts through the middle of what was the Debatable Lands.

It was probably seen as not particularly worth fighting for or defending

Gretna and its Green may be affectionately known as a safe haven for young lovers looking to elope, but the town also has an illustrious industrial heritage owing to the production of munitions for World War One, which drastically reshaped the community. The architecture reflects the early 20th Century well, such as the once-upon-a-time colonial revival-style cinema, whose adjoining cafe I was thawing out in.

The line between Scotland and England was established with the Treaty of York in 1237. As Graham Robb writes in his 2018 book, The Debatable Land: The Lost World Between Scotland and England, it is “probably the oldest national boundary in Europe”. But when it was finalised, it seems that it drew a line through lands that were essentially familial, dividing some held territory in two. Therefore, the border symbolised state-led authority and the Debatable Lands became the flashpoint of a rebellion of sorts, where powerful families plundered each other in both Scotland and England and neither government was committed to sorting it out.

The region became a no-go zone, a hazardous region frequented by the Border Reivers; “reiving” being a Scots word for plundering or raiding. Reivers busied themselves with a cat-and-mouse style game of stealing each other’s livestock. As Groundwater points out, that this occurred both “across the border and within each kingdom” shows that it was “not only English versus Scottish but internal crime, too”. Although raids weren’t confined solely to the Debatable Lands, most of the bloodiest took place in this untouchable territory, and it essentially became Britain’s fourth country, sitting alongside England, Wales and Scotland: a miniature, no-go area abiding by its own rules.

[It is] probably the oldest national boundary in Europe

The wild, often barren landscape, punctuated only by small communities, certainly adds to the effect. Towns such as Canonbie and Langholm are now local centres for fishing and hiking but grew from the remains of family settlements within the Debatable Lands. There are other well-marked ways of getting personal with the outdoors here. The coast-to-coast Reivers Cycle Route, for example, is a 173-mile stretch from that takes in many Borderland highlights including the Debatable Lands, although, you can pick and choose sections.

Taking another brief detour from the A7, I found myself in Rowanburn, a village with a well-kept public garden and the unmissable imposing wooden carving of Lang Sandy, so-called for his considerable height at more than 6ft, very tall for the 16th Century. Full name Alexander Armstrong, he was the last chief of the all-powerful Scottish Armstrong clan in the Debatable Lands, and a much revered and feared reiver. He long resisted attempts at pacification by the Crown and was eventually hanged with his 11 sons in around 1610, a fate that was to befall many of the region’s reivers.

The place I really wanted to visit, however, was nearby Gilnockie Tower. Mere minutes from Rowanburn, I was soon ambling up the driveway to what is one of the finest remaining examples of a lowland Pele tower ­­– a compact fortified keep built for defence, unique to the border region – and now home to the Clan Armstrong Centre, a small museum and essential Debatable Lands stopping point.

Confusingly it’s also known as Hollows Tower due to its adjacent location to Hollows Village, something that Ian Martin, project manager at the tower, explained as we headed inside the depths of the more than 500-year-old building.

Perhaps because there are few tangible remains from the period, Gilnockie Tower is a space in which the Debatable Lands comes alive. It’s every bit the defensive tower, from its impenetrably thick stone walls to its tiny high windows and roof-top lookout where you can easily picture a guard keeping watch. The tower, which endeavours to open all year, houses a small exhibition and cafe, and, as Martin tells me, offers tours (booked in advance) that “are designed to take people well into the 16th Century, deep enough to give them a flavour of family life at that difficult period”, including, for example, everyday conditions and the daily chores and traditional dining habits of those living through this unruly time.

Discussing my route along the A7, Martin tells me that there’s a desire to see a more concerted effort in attracting visitors to the region: “As you drive up the road to Canonbie, Gilnockie Tower, Langholm and on through the Borderlands,” he said, “the history of the textile industry, both woven and knitted wear, is presented in some wonderful exhibitions [in the likes of Hawick, close to the Debatable Lands]. Much more of these experiences are being developed, all in the effort to open up a visitor route through the A7 corridor that has fundamentally been ignored for years.”

The region’s remoteness, however, was of no concern to the reivers of their day. The Debatable Lands existed in its isolated manner until, officially speaking, 1551, when an agreement between the two countries prompted the building of Scots’ Dike in 1552, which “settled the exact boundary between the countries of Scotland and England,” according to Martin. This man-made embankment, little of which is visible today, was a three-and-a-half-mile-long barrier that finally divided the Debatable Lands in two.

It was initially more symbolic than practical, as this barrier did nothing to stem the flow of reiving. It wasn’t until 1603 that the border areas became a real focus for the unifying monarch, King James VI & I, King of Scotland and the first Stuart King of England, following the Union of the Crowns. New wardens were put in charge of tidying up the region and prominent reivers were rounded up. Some, like Lang Sandy, were hanged, many were exiled, and the process of instilling a semblance of law and order began in earnest.

Winding northwards up the A7, with Gilnockie Tower in the rear-view mirror, I struggled to get my head around how this small patch of land, the most debatable of areas, had excelled at such remarkable lawlessness with colourful characters and tales to boot, while, simultaneously, remaining so very under the radar.

And that’s where the appeal in the Debatable Lands lies; the intrigue of this unfathomable period and, by association, the surrounding towns and villages of the Borderlands, whose natural landscapes remain – almost – as wild and untamed as in the days of the reivers.

248,The indigenous communities that predicted Covid-19,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200503-the-indigenous-communities-that-predicted-covid-19,['Rachel Nuwer'],"Inside the world’s tropical forests, there are the agents of disease that have the power to bring our way of life to a halt. How we learn to live with these forests will determine our fate, hastening or slowing the onset of future pandemics and the climate crisis. BBC Travel and Future Planet explore two sides of our relationship with forests in two stories; this story is the first, and you can read the second here.

Levi Sucre Romero remembers hearing the news back in January about a novel coronavirus infecting people in China. “I honestly didn’t believe it would make it this far,” he said. “I felt like it was really far away.”

A member and leader of the Bribri, one of Costa Rica’s largest indigenous groups, Romero lives in Talamanca, a remote, mountainous region in the south of the country full of meandering rivers, dense jungle canopies and a near-constant drizzle of warm rain. Though the thatched-roof wooden homes of Talamanca Bribri, the group’s territory, are far removed from the country’s popular tourist hubs, Romero soon realised that it was only a matter of time until the virus reached them.

Romero also realised something else: the virus, he believes, was unleashed by human greed and ill treatment of the planet. “We’re unbalancing the habitat of species, we’re cutting down trees, we’re planting monocultures, we’re filling the world with cities and asphalt and we’re using too many chemicals,” Romero said. “It’s a cocktail of bad practices.”

Like Sars and Mers, two other recent, deadly coronaviruses, Covid-19 is a zoonotic disease that came from an animal. Evidence points to its likely origin in a bat, followed by a potential crossover into an intermediary species – possibly a pangolin – before transmission into humans at a wet market in Wuhan, China. While Covid-19’s exact origins have yet to be pinpointed, overwhelming research shows that deforestation and commercial wildlife trade heighten the risk of zoonotic diseases that can potentially cause pandemics. And according to Romero, both are human activities that entail the destruction of nature.

“My people have cultural knowledge that says when Sibö, our God, created Earth, he locked up some bad spirits,” Romero said. “These spirits come out when we’re not respecting nature and living together.”

Romero coordinates the Mesoamerican Alliance of People and Forests, one of the most important land-rights platforms for indigenous communities in Central America and Mexico, which represents more than 50,000 people who live in the most densely forested lands in the region. He knows for a fact that there is another, more sustainable and respectful way to live in relation to the Earth – because the Bribri and many other indigenous groups around the world practice it.

I do not believe this will be the last pandemic of this type

For years, Romero and other indigenous leaders have been urging the rest of the world to adopt a more indigenous-inspired way of coexisting with nature, including leaving habitats intact, harvesting plants and animals at sustainable levels and acknowledging and respecting the connection between human and planetary health. Now, they are reiterating that message in light of the coronavirus.

At a March panel sponsored by the global journalism initiative Covering Climate Now in New York City, held days before the city shut down and later became the global epicentre of the worldwide pandemic, Romero and other indigenous leaders from Brazil and Indonesia emphasised the role that traditional knowledge, practices and land stewardship can play in protecting the planet. These protections, they said, extend not just to lessening climate change and biodiversity loss, but to reducing the risk of future pandemics.

“We are convinced that this pandemic is the result of a wrong use of natural resources and a wrong way of living together with these resources,” Romero said. “I do not believe this will be the last pandemic of this type.”

A wealth of research supports the link between novel disease emergence and environmental destruction. Many viruses naturally occur in animal species, and deforestation increases the odds of people coming into contact with an animal carrying a virus that is new to humanity, potentially resulting in a spill-over event. A 2017 Nature Communications paper revealed that emerging zoonotic disease risk is highest in tropical forests that are experiencing land-use changes, including from logging, mining, dam building and road development. As the authors report, such activities carry an intrinsic risk of disease emergence because they disrupt ecological dynamics and increase contact between humans, livestock and wildlife.

“It’s a stochastic process,” said Erin Mordecai, a biologist at Stanford University. “It’s driven by chance encounters between particular people and particular animals, and what pathogens they’re carrying at that time.”

Deforestation can also spread existing diseases. In October, Mordecai and co-author Andrew MacDonald reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that an increase in deforestation in Brazil tends to increase the rate of malaria transmission, with about six-and-a-half new cases occurring per square kilometre of cut-down forest. The reason, they believe, is that cutting trees creates more forest edge – the favourite breeding habitat for Brazil’s malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Development in frontier regions also brings more people closer to the forest and draws pioneers in from other parts of the country who have never been exposed to malaria and thus have no resistance.

Deforestation tends to lead to these opportunities in which species that don’t normally come into contact are coming into contact

While every disease is different, the general pattern, Mordecai told me, is that deforestation disrupts ecosystems and creates edge habitats hovering between domesticated and wild, in which the human and natural world overlap. “Deforestation tends to lead to these opportunities in which species that don’t normally come into contact are coming into contact,” she said. “That creates opportunities for pathogens to spill over.”

Studies reveal that the both legal and illegal commercial wildlife trade also increase the risk of new diseases emerging by subjecting wild animals to stressful, unhygienic conditions. Still-living species are often mixed together, allowing them to exchange viruses. Trade also often takes place in urban centres, where many people may come into contact with the animals – and with each other – further encouraging a new disease’s spread.

The wildlife trade itself is also linked to deforestation. Hunters and poachers tend to access wilderness areas through roads. As formerly remote areas are opened up by new transportation corridors, wildlife trade tends to follow.

Medical experts and conservationists have been warning of the health risks posed by both deforestation and wildlife trade for decades, but to no avail. In 2003, for example, China briefly banned wildlife trade in response to Sars, but business resumed within a year and has only grown since.

As land stewards, many indigenous groups help to guard against these threats. “By protecting indigenous landscapes, you’re protecting not only those people and their way of life, but also preventing really rapid transformation of landscapes,” Mordecai said. “That rapid transformation has huge-scale cultural and environmental consequences, but also disease-transmission consequences.”

How travellers can help protect indigenous land “Indigenous tourism” directly engages indigenous people to let them share their culture and land on their own terms. According to the United Nations’ World Tourism Organization, “indigenous tourism can spur cultural interaction and revival, bolster employment, alleviate poverty, curb rural flight migration, empower women and youth, encourage product diversification, and nurture a sense of pride among indigenous people.” To ensure that your travel will directly benefit the people whose culture and land you experience, the World Indigenous Tourism Alliance recommends booking indigenous-owned-and-operated tours. Fortunately, indigenous-led travel experiences have recently surged in places like Australia, Canada and the US. In the last few years, the Bribri launched Costa Rica’s first indigenous-operated tour agency, which teaches visitors about the group’s worldview and spiritual connection to the land, with all funds going back to the community.

A large number of indigenous groups live in tropical forests – precisely the landscapes with the highest risk for new disease emergence, and also the places facing the highest rates of deforestation. Tropical deforestation is accelerating and accounts for about 90% of total deforestation worldwide. A 2020 study reported that at least 36% of the world’s remaining intact forests – half of which are located in the tropics – fall within indigenous lands.

Of course, indigenous people are extremely diverse. Some live in cities, others in forests; some extract resources for profit, others use nature only for subsistence. In general, though, indigenous groups “are much more effective at protecting the forest and environment on their lands than most other users,” said Mary Menton, a research fellow in environmental justice at the University of Sussex. In certain parts of Brazil, for example, indigenous protection is visible in satellite images from space.

“You can see exactly where the lines of indigenous territories are,” Menton said. “Deforestation eats into forests around where indigenous areas are, and those areas really act as an effective barrier for expansion.”

Indigenous people’s lands, by and large, tend to be much better protected than other areas of the forest

This is also supported by scientific evidence. A 2012 study comparing 40 protected areas and 33 community-managed forests revealed that the community-managed areas suffered less deforestation. “If we look across the tropics, indigenous people’s lands, by and large, tend to be much better protected than other areas of the forest, even comparing community and indigenous lands to protected areas,” Menton said.

Practically speaking, this is partly because indigenous people tend to live on large areas of land with relatively small populations. But even groups that live in smaller tracts of forest in north-east Brazil, for example, live more sustainably than much of the rest of humanity. “It’s not just that they have lots of forest, it’s the way they treat and see the forest, and interact with it,” Menton said.

Many groups have been living in forested areas for generations and view the landscape as part of their community. Some also believe that their ancestors are part of the forest. Protecting nature, therefore, isn’t just about ecology and biodiversity, Menton says, but also about preserving lives, history and culture.

Indigenous people accomplish this through a variety of means that largely boil down to having a respect and awareness of the effect they have on the forest, Menton said. The Bribri, for example, divide their land into family and community areas, each of which have internal rules designed to promote sustainability. For example, members of the community can cut as many leaves as they want from local suita palms – used to make everything from houses to brooms – so long as they leave at least five leaves on each harvested plant so it can produce more leaves.

We need to rethink the model of development that’s based on accumulating wealth while destroying resources

Many indigenous people also do not treat the forest as a means or impediment to getting rich. Romero, for his part, thinks that hyper-globalisation and consumerism are at the heart of many of the world’s ills. “We need to rethink the model of development that’s based on accumulating wealth while destroying resources,” Romero said. “I see an economic model that is predatory to resources and to nature, that causes a lack of balance in the world.”

However, profit-driven companies, governments and individuals often view indigenous people as standing in the way of economic growth. Around the world, indigenous land rights are under attack by agriculture, mining and other extractive industries. Between 2002 and 2017, Menton found that more than 1,500 environmental defenders were murdered in 50 countries, and that indigenous peoples died in higher numbers than any other group on the list. In 2015 and 2016, for example, indigenous people represented 40% of all murdered environmental defenders. A report published in April 2020 by the Pastoral Land Commission, a non-profit organisation in Brazil, likewise revealed that one-third of all families who faced land conflicts in rural Brazil in 2019 were indigenous.

Menton adds that indigenous people face additional threats because of racism and “perceptions that they’re second-class citizens”. Often, this is a problem promoted from the top down. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, recently said, for example, that “Indians are evolving” to become “increasingly human, like us”. Indigenous people, in other words, are “facing threats both in terms of actual physical conflicts over land, but also cultural threats and attacks over their right to exist,” Menton said.

Attacks on indigenous rights are not just attacks on individual cultures, Romero says, but on the health of the planet as a whole. “When we have rights over our forests and our lands, that means survival for us, for our families,” he said. “But it also means we have a better probability of avoiding pandemics.”

The Bribri, like much of the world, are now on lockdown. “The rhythm of our lives has been cut short,” he said. Visits with elders are no longer permitted, sales of produce to the national market have dropped by around 90%, and the group’s cultural and ecological tourism efforts – including guided trips to mountains and rivers, traditional food tours and home stays on family ranches – have stopped as well. “I could go on and on. There’s a lot of impacts,” Romero said.

Once the world does emerge from Covid-19, Romero hopes that there will be a silver lining to all of the suffering, loss and hardship that it has caused. He hopes that people will be more receptive to the knowledge that he and other indigenous leaders have to offer, and that humanity will begin to re-evaluate its relationship with nature.

“I think we have a long way to go, but after the coronavirus, I have faith that this will open up some space with governments,” Romero said. “After this pandemic, governments should listen more.”

249,Asia’s centuries-old healing technique,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200428-asias-centuries-old-healing-technique,['Matthew Keegan'],"It’s early morning in Hong Kong. As the roar of traffic and rush of the commute begin, the city moves to its usual pulsing rhythm. But in the heart of one of the most hectic urban jungles on Earth is an unlikely garden of calm and healing – a little oasis where the pace is decidedly slower.

Located in Hong Kong Park, a lush green space in the centre of the city, is a dedicated tai chi garden. Designed with a courtyard for practicing, and decorated with bonsai trees, it has a serene quality that comes as a pleasant surprise in an area otherwise dominated by skyscrapers and the rush of city life. The garden is used frequently, if not daily, as locals gather in parks like this across the city, mostly in the morning, to practice the centuries-old martial art.

It’s here under the early morning light that a group of tai chi students, led by their teacher, Master Chow, are using the garden as their classroom. They run through what’s known in tai chi as a “form” – a sequence of fluid moves.

To an observer, the movements appear effortless. The students glide and flow seamlessly from one move to the next, exuding a calmness that’s far removed from the bustling streets nearby. Passers-by stop and watch, momentarily soothed by the movements that, although gentle, cut a powerful presence.

“People think that tai chi is just soft. But it’s all things – gentle, explosive, delicate, calm and full of wisdom,” said Chow. “There are 1,000 words to define it, but there are no words to fully describe it.”

Tai chi is a type of ancient Chinese martial art that is widely believed to have originated more than 400 years ago during the Ming dynasty. Chen Wangting (1600-1680), a local military commander from the Chenjiagou village in Henan Province, has historically been recognised as the first person to create and practice tai chi. After retiring from the army, Wangting created tai chi as a fighting art to protect his family against thieves and bandits. He integrated the skills of different martial art styles with elements of the Taoist yin-yang philosophy – the idea that everything consists of two opposing forces that harmonise with each other to create a whole – as well as theories drawn from Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Nowadays, tai chi is mainly practiced as a low-to moderate-intensity exercise combined with meditation, body awareness, imagery and controlled breathing. Its main objective is to achieve longevity through mind and body conditioning.

Tai chi maintains cardiorespiratory function, muscular fitness and joint flexibility

The ancient practice is immensely popular throughout China, but it is particularly beloved in Hong Kong for its ability to relieve stress and improve health. With famously small living spaces in Hong Kong, going to the city’s parks or tai chi gardens is a good way to be out in the open while getting some exercise. Hong Kong also has a rapidly ageing population – about one third of its population will be aged 65 or above by 2038 – and the city’s elderly citizens are encouraged by the government to attend classes in the morning, which are often followed by tea and dim sum with their teacher and classmates. Not only do tai chi classes promote healthy movement, but they provide the elderly with a social community and combat isolation.

Some experts point to the health benefits of tai chi as a reason lifespan has increased in Hong Kong over the last 50 years. Hong Kong has the highest life expectancy in the world. Women in the city live, on average, to 87.6 years of age and men to 81.9, beating such places as Japan and Italy, which are renowned for their longevity. “Prior study has indicated that this longevity increase is associated with the more active lifestyle of the elderly today,” said Aileen Chan, professor at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, whose research expertise is tai chi. “Tai chi maintains cardiorespiratory function, muscular fitness and joint flexibility. To promote a longer life, it is recommended to practice tai chi regularly for at least 30 minutes a day and at least five times a week, preferably every day.”

Chow is the founder of the Chen Style Tai Chi Institute in Hong Kong where he has taught more than 3,000 local and international students over a period of 19 years. Born into a martial arts family, Chow was inspired by his father, a kung fu master, who he describes as a humble man with great power and strength but who never showed off.

“When I was 16 years old, I knew the power of tai chi from books and I was amazed by its philosophy,” said Chow. “So, I decided to take classes, and this is how I started my tai chi journey.”

Chow was fortunate to learn the Chen-style of tai chi – the original form of tai chi – at its birthplace in Henan province, in mainland China. (There are four other traditional styles: Yang, Wu, Wu Hao and Sun; each have different movements and can look very different from one another.) After a few years of observation and training, the Chen family accepted him to be an inheritor, meaning that he could officially teach as a master of Chen-style in Hong Kong.

Mentally, it has taught me how to think and how to control my emotions

Chow enjoys tai chi for both its physical and mental benefits. “Mentally, tai chi is an ancient Chinese method which is a natural and unique way to help relieve stress and soothe our soul,” he said. “Physically, it helps build joint movement in the knees and back, improves balance and fall prevention, adds muscle strength and flexibility and training coordination.” That’s because the movements are usually circular and never forced, the muscles are relaxed rather than tensed, the joints are not fully extended or bent, and connective tissues are not stretched. Chow says he has experienced the health benefits himself.

“When I was a child, I always used to have a fever and coughing,” he said. “But as I grew up and started to practice tai chi, year by year, my health changed, and it has made me very strong now. Mentally, also, it has taught me how to think and how to control my emotions.”

Chow firmly believes that tai chi can be self-healing. “It can help people a lot, especially in a busy city like Hong Kong,” he said. “It can bring peace of mind and soothe the soul. This is very important.”

And as Chow wraps up leading his students through a series of movements in the Tai Chi Garden – among them signature movements like “Buddha pestle” (a punching movement) and “white goose spreading wings” (an advance-and-retreat movement, just like a goose when it opens its wings and jumps very fast suddenly) – it’s certainly soothing to observe. But there’s more to it than one might first assume.

The learning process for Chen-style tai chi is split into 15 levels. Level one involves learning 74 movements as a sequence, which is called a “form”. “When you finish level one, we use the same form (74 movements) in the other 14 levels, but you go deeper and you learn the internal power in the other levels,” said Chow.

• Is this Japan's miracle drink?

• Hong Kong's secret night meal

Going deeper involves more than just correctly learning the movements, but ensuring that both the external movements and the internal part, the Qi (energy), are moving together as yin and yang. By stimulating the internal energy (Qi) flow it helps to recharge the body and helps to detoxify.

“Tai chi exercise involves the recognition, development, and use of Qi, which refers to the energy in the body,” explained Professor Chan. “Based on theoretical principles that are inherent to traditional Chinese medicine, Qi is the fundamental energy that sustains life and flows in the body along channels called meridians and collaterals, which enhance the integration of all organ systems and tissues, and promote good health and longevity.”

Chow explains how he uses Qi in his own practice. “At the end of each movement in tai chi, we hold the posture until the Qi energy goes down and back to the earth. We call this state ‘Yin’,” said Chow. “Then you can start the next movement and take the Qi from the earth again with breathing to guide the energy to rotate and circulate inside your body. We call this state ‘Yang’. So, the entire sequence of 74 movements contains rhythm and changing of the speed. Alternately yin and yang. This is the meaning of tai chi.”

The meaning of tai chi is something that fellow Hong Kong-based tai chi teacher, Linda Fung, wishes more people better understood.

“We often misunderstand tai chi,” said Fung. “When we say tai chi, people tend to think it’s just moving your arms and legs and doing some movement exercise, but tai chi moves are part of a subset of tai chi philosophy.”

Fung, who practices and teaches the Li-style of tai chi, says that tai chi is more than just the physical movements, it’s a way of life. It encompasses arts, music, lifestyle, she said, and you have to understand the yin and yang that is the core of tai chi.

“In tai chi it’s the interconnection between the yin, which is the body, and yang, which is our mind,” said Fung. “So it’s always the mind and body moving and working together.""

At an 11th-floor yoga studio – a sanctuary of calm overlooking Hong Kong’s dizzying central business district – Fung guides her students through a beginners’ class. Trained as a ballet dancer at the Royal Ballet School in London and later at the Julliard School in New York, she exudes a natural grace that embodies all her movements.

In addition to teaching classes, Fung practices tai chi herself every morning, often outdoors, and says it helps her to achieve a balance in her life.

“In tai chi you slow down your movement, but yet you’re still breathing in certain patterns and so it is movement meditation,” said Fung. “With that level of focus, time just disappears, it’s like there is no time. It’s a great feeling.”

The ability to be able to slow down and to have clarity and awareness even when things are in crisis, is, for Fung, one of the best health benefits of tai chi. “With tai chi practice, even when situations are out of hand, you can still retain a calmness like an eye of the storm. That is the core of tai chi: it’s about harmony.”

And Fung believes that tai chi is a treasure trove of good stuff that has never been more needed in the world. “We have to share it with everyone, particularly now, in the 21st Century, where there are so many ways that we are distracted with problems and even illnesses. Tai chi is really very important for people, to give us a chance for happiness, wisdom and health.”

250,America’s ‘fried chicken war’,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200429-americas-fried-chicken-war,['Diana Lambdin Meyer'],"Located in the heart of the US’ Great Plains, the area around Pittsburg, Kansas, spreads out like one vast prairie. Here, the winds blow bitter cold in winter; the sun parches the soil in summer; and ranchers, farmers and folks from this 20,000-person community gather to watch Friday night football at the local high school. By all accounts, this former coal-mining town is pretty tranquil – that is, until the topic of fried chicken comes up.

Our coverage during coronavirus While travelling is on hold due to the coronavirus outbreak, BBC Travel will continue to inform and inspire our readers who want to learn about the world as much as they want to travel there, offering stories that celebrate the people, places and cultures that make this world so wonderfully diverse and amazing. For travel information and stories specifically related to coronavirus, please read the latest updates from our colleagues at BBC News.

Over the past 80 years, this unassuming city has become one of the US’ fried chicken epicentres, and it all started when two women opened chicken joints 300ft apart on the same street – thus creating a local rivalry that still spits and simmers today. Four generations later, their descendants still use their grandmothers’ recipes to continue their legacies, and in many ways, who these women were and how their crispy birds got Pittsburg clucking speaks volumes about the heart and history of America’s Heartland.

The plains surrounding Pittsburg have always been home to large deposits of bituminous coal. These pitch-black rocks were once so abundant that they were found above ground. The Osage Native Americans who once lived here called it “black rocks that make fire”, and they traded it with white settlers.

The first miners arrived in 1866, just one year after the US Civil War ended. Digging deep shafts and breaking apart loads of coal was dangerous, back-breaking work. Soon, notices went out across Europe seeking immigrants to come work in Pittsburg and the surrounding Crawford County. At the height of coal production here in 1914, more than 12,000 miners and their families called Crawford County home, and this rural patch of roughly 55,000 people produced more than one third of the US’ coal.

One of the families who settled in the area was the Rehaks, who sailed over from Austria at the turn of the 20th Century, carrying their infant daughter, Annie. As a teenager, Annie married Charles Pichler. The couple had three children and bought a house in the shadow of the coal mine just outside Pittsburg where Charles worked.

In the middle of Charles’ shift one day in March 1933, the mine whistle blew four times, indicating that there had been an accident. Charles had been hit by a coal cart on the mine tracks. His right leg was amputated on site and his left leg was badly maimed. At the time, there was no such thing as workman’s compensation or disability insurance, and Annie was forced to provide for her family of five in the middle of the US’ Great Depression all alone.

Grandma never talked much about those times, but it had to have been tough

To keep her family from starving, Annie began selling ham and veal sandwiches for a few pennies to miners passing the front of her house. The men ate under the shade of the birch and maple trees outside the Pichlers’ little white house, not far from the outhouses, and drank Annie’s homemade hooch, which she sold for $0.25 for two quarts.

“Grandma never talked much about those times, but it had to have been tough,” said Anthony Pichler, Annie’s grandson. “But Grandma was tough too, and that’s why we’re here today.”

In 1934, looking for a way to grow her business and noting all the free-range chickens in her front yard, Annie started selling fried chicken dinners. She’d wring the birds’ necks, quickly clean and cut them into pieces and fry them on a coal-heated stove in her tiny kitchen. On Saturdays, Annie would move the furniture from the family’s living room and set up a few tables for diners in their tiny home. She also prepared potato salad, coleslaw, pickled peppers and sliced tomatoes from her garden as sides, and rounded the meals out with a slice of white bread. Sometimes, diners would stay and end up dancing until the wee hours of the morning.

One day not long after Annie started her business, a local doctor and fan of Annie’s cooking suggested she name her homespun business “Chicken Annie’s”. The name has stuck like grease on a pan ever since.

Sometimes, diners would stay and end up dancing until the wee hours of the morning

In 1941, a pair of German immigrants, Joe and Mary Zerngast, lived a few doors down from the Pichlers. Joe worked the mines as a “shot-firer”, meaning he was the guy who would go deep inside, light the dynamite and run out – hopefully before it exploded. It was one of the most dangerous jobs in the mines, and after 20 years, “black lung” (coal workers’ pneumoconiosis) cut his career short, leaving Mary to provide for the family.

The Zerngasts also had chickens clucking around in their front yard, a big cast-iron skillet and a coal-fired stove. And like Annie, Mary was a pretty good cook, too. So, just as the Pichlers had done, the Zerngasts cleared out the furniture in their little living room, set up tables and began selling fried chicken dinners with potato salad and coleslaw.

Chicken Annie’s and Chicken Mary’s quickly developed a friendly rivalry, with locals in this tight-knit community having to pick a side

“I needed to survive,” Larry Zerngast, Mary’s grandson, recalled Mary telling the family.

At first, the Zerngasts called their little place, “Joe and Mary’s”. They had a jukebox in the living room and, just like at Annie’s, people often danced until the early morning. If locals under the influence arrived in the middle of the night craving fried chicken, they would often pound on the door, shouting, “Chicken, Mary! Chicken, Mary!”. Mary would open the door, fire up the coal stove and fry chicken until dawn – thus, Chicken Mary’s was born.

The Pichler’s and Zerngast’s little houses soon got so busy with dinners and dancing that the families had to move so they could devote their former homes solely to the restaurant business. Word continued to spread of the families’ mouth-watering, deep-fried birds after World War Two, and poultry pilgrims would drive hours across Kansas to dine at Annie’s or Mary’s – or sometimes, both. As more people flocked to eat at their venues in the 1960s and ‘70s, the ladies tore down their original houses and expanded again, building modern restaurants with commercial kitchens that could seat about 300 instead of 30.

“She always had a smile and would greet her guests by name,” said Donna Lipoglav, Annie’s granddaughter, who recalled that Annie’s waitresses always wore crisp white dresses and aprons. “She was very sweet and gentle, and no, I don’t think she would approve of my sweatshirt today.”

Despite having nearly identical recipes and side dishes, Chicken Annie’s and Chicken Mary’s quickly developed a friendly rivalry, with locals in this tight-knit community having to pick a side and be careful who saw them entering the door of which restaurant.

Lipoglav’s earliest memories are of working in the house with her grandmother, clearing tables and serving guests. Occasionally, Annie would ask her to ride her bike down the street to count the number of cars in Chicken Mary’s parking lot. “I think Grandma was alert as to what was going on,” Lipoglav said. “Our parking lot was always just as full as Mary’s.”

My Grandpa Joe always said, ‘Don’t turn your back on a Pichler, you can’t trust them!

In 1982, the Pichlers tried to rename the small street running in front of both establishments “Chicken Annie’s Road”. When the Zerngasts objected to that, the incident made national headlines with a tongue-in-cheek article in The New Yorker titled, “Fried-Chicken War”.

“My Grandpa Joe always said, ‘Don’t turn your back on a Pichler, you can’t trust them!’,” Donna Zerngast, Mary’s granddaughter, laughed.

Today, Pittsburg’s first families of fried chicken are still at it, with Lipoglav running Chicken Annie’s Original, Larry Zerngast running Chicken Mary’s and Anthony Pichler running Pichler’s Chicken Annie’s alongside an unlikely co-owner: Donna Zerngast, who must not have listened to Grandpa Joe’s advice and has now been married to a Pichler for the last 54 years.

Other than the size of the buildings and the fact that they’re no longer wringing the chickens’ necks themselves, all three businesses still do everything just about the same way Annie and Mary did in the 1930s and ‘40s. Each still batters their birds, then coats them with flour and salt just minutes before frying them in lard. Chicken Mary’s uses egg and milk in the batter; whereas Chicken Annie’s Original and Pichler’s Chicken Annie’s uses just egg.

We have customers who just show up from all across the country because they’ve heard of us and the fried chicken in this part of Kansas

To this Midwesterner, the chicken at both Annie’s and Mary’s has a crisp, light crunch and a tender, juicy inside. But Pittsburg residents know the difference.

“You can put a plate of our chicken next to a plate of their chicken and locals will know which one is which,” said Lana Brooks, who has worked at Chicken Mary’s for 51 years and claims that both families use the same seasonings, just in different amounts. “I think the key to success in both restaurants is that we’re still doing things exactly as Mary and Annie did it. That’s part of the appeal to families who have been coming here their whole life. It’s a part of our community heritage.”

Over the years, Chicken Annie’s and Mary’s have inspired at least nine other homespun fried chicken joints in Crawford County. “We have very loyal customers, but every week, we have customers who just show up from all across the country because they’ve heard of us and the fried chicken in this part of Kansas,” said Missy Pichler, the fourth generation of Pichlers to work at Chicken Annie’s Original and whose teenage daughter also waits tables there.

Every few months, Steve and Melissa Pulis and their boys drive about two hours from Springfield, Missouri, to Pittsburg, eating at Chicken Mary’s on one trip and Chicken Annie’s the next.

“I like Annie’s chicken the best, but Steve likes Mary’s the best,” said Melissa. “But it’s the opposite with the coleslaw. I really like the extra garlic in Mary’s coleslaw. Steve disagrees.”

And that’s the way it goes in Crawford County. Families here are divided in a delicious brawl over fried chicken and the fixins.

Al Eshelbrenner grew up just north of Pittsburg and has been eating fried chicken dinners for nearly 60 years. While he admits that Chicken Mary’s is good, he insists that the difference lies in the seasoning. Today, he maintains his parents’ allegiance and now takes his grandchildren to Chicken Annie’s. “My folks would take us to Chicken Annie’s every Sunday and that’s just what I grew up with,” said Eshelbrenner. “People don’t really argue about it down here because we respect that everyone has their favourites, their family tradition.”

In fact, the Eshelbrenners are so devoted to Chicken Annie’s that they ask the restaurant to cater their family’s Christmas gatherings.

“I think it’s the potato salad and coleslaw that I crave the most,” said Kristian Walker, who was born and raised in Pittsburg but now lives in Harrisburg, PA. Although he no longer has family living in the area, he once drove five hours out of his way just so he could have a fried chicken dinner in Pittsburg.

“I’ve met people from across the country who, as soon as they learn I’m from Pittsburg, start asking me about my favourite fried chicken and telling about the times they’ve been able to eat [it],” he said. “We might not be world famous, but there are sure a lot of people around the world who know about the fried chicken of Crawford County, Kansas.”

251,Bali’s day of quiet reflection,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200430-where-lockdown-is-an-annual-tradition,['Elly Earls'],"It was early afternoon on 25 March in Bali, and for the first time in a long time I could hear myself think. There were no scooters zooming by, no noodle sellers peddling their wares, not even the occasional sound of a plane flying overhead.

In their absence, I noticed the buzz of a dragonfly and a frog’s ribbit as I sat quietly on my porch, trying to get into the spirit of Nyepi – the island’s New Year’s Day, or “Silent Day” – when for 24 hours Balinese people stay quietly in their homes and reflect on the year gone by and gear up for the one to come.

Usually, Balinese New Year’s Day is the calm after the storm. On a typical Balinese New Year’s Eve, the island is a riot of noise and colour. For months, locals have worked on building their neighbourhood’s ogoh-ogoh, a huge effigy made from bamboo and papier-mâché in the shape of a demon. On the big day, the effigies are paraded through the streets in theatrical, boisterous ceremonies.

Also, gamelan bands play while Balinese people practise pengrupukan, which at the household level, is a ceremony that involves brushing a burning bundle of dried coconut leaves against the base of every shrine and building to the accompaniment of noisemaking on bamboo tubes and pot lids while shouting for demons to leave. Over time, the New Year’s Eve ceremony has spilled out from households to public parades with bamboo torches on the streets to rid the whole neighbourhood and town of demons.

Each year, Balinese New Year takes place on a different day as it’s governed by the “Saka” calendar, which is based on the phases of the moon. The Saka dynasty was first founded in 78AD by King Kanishka of India and was said to have been brought to Java by Hindu missionaries and later spread to Bali, which today is the only remaining island in Indonesia with a Hindu majority in a country that’s 90% Muslim.

Celebrations start three days before Nyepi with Melasti, where holy images from temples are taken by procession to the nearest sea, lake, river or spring, where they’re cleansed of any physical or spiritual impurities and people make offerings and pray to their newly purified deities. Two days later, at noon on the eve of Nyepi, tawur agung (pay-offs) of animal sacrifices, raw meat, eggs and liquor are offered to demons along with loud music and noises, which both attract them and then send them away once they’re appeased.

“The practice of getting buta-kala (demons) to leave goes back far in time,” said Garrett Kam, who has been living in South-East Asia for more than 30 years and is the only non-Balinese ritual assistant at Pura Samuan Tiga temple in Bedulu, Gianyar, where he lives. “Every temple ceremony in Bali is preceded by caru (demon-appeasing sacrifices) so that their malevolent desires are satisfied and they become benevolent deities.

Kam continued: “At noon on the eve of Nyepi, such tawur agung or big payoffs occur on a large scale in every village, town, city and district to pay off the demons that accumulate during the year. Every 10 and 100 years, they happen at the island's most important temples to pay off accumulating demons from the decade and century.”

This year, the festivities were heavily scaled back, reminding Kam of his first Nyepi in Bali in the 1980s.

“Ogoh-ogoh were only allowed to be shown around the banjar (local community) that made them and without parades,” he said. “And while some youth groups protested as they had spent thousands of dollars and many weeks on their ogoh-ogoh, most people understood why the parades were banned.”

One thing, though, remained unchanged. While many people across the world are finding the coronavirus lockdown to be a shock to the system, the Balinese are used to it. Every year on Nyepi, the entire island falls silent.

No-one is allowed to leave their homes where they are meant to spend their day with no fire or light (that means no work and no entertainment). Businesses are closed and even the airport shuts down for 24 hours. Some Balinese also fast, turn off their phones and do not speak except in short whispers. Even dogs and roosters are quieter than usual, according to Kam. The local police patrol the streets and beaches to make sure nobody is flouting the rules.

The silence that this time provides is truly the best way to meditate

The reason they do this is because, according to Balinese beliefs, any demons that might return will think the island is deserted and leave it alone for another year. But the Balinese also use this time to reflect on the past year and set goals for the future.

“The silence that this time provides is truly the best way to meditate,” said Sri Darwiati, a Balinese Hindu who was raised in a village in the island’s Tabanan regency and is now school secretary and a board member at Green School Bali. “I have been celebrating and enjoying Nyepi day for more than 40 years, and as I am getting older, I continue to learn the significance behind the ritual.”

She believes spending time at home with your family, even just for a day, can bring joy, and that taking time to reflect can help make us more productive in the future. For Kam, this is all the more important now because the Balinese generally lead very active lives and are rarely at home. “Nyepi allows a full day for them to reconnect with their families without being distracted by TV and internet,” he said.

With social distancing measures now in place in Bali, following one extra day of Nyepi, which was extended this year due to the coronavirus, the benefits associated with “Silent Day” are stretching further. “Fathers are teaching their sons gamelan music and art. My neighbour is learning to play the ukulele on his own. Mothers are teaching their daughters household skills and to help out at their small kiosks and roadside stalls,” Kam said. “This all means a continuing of traditions not learned in classrooms and increased respect for elders who have more roles to fulfil today.”

Nyepi has also been shown to have a positive impact on the environment, even if it is just for 24 hours. A 2015 study by the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics found that total suspended particulate (TSP) concentrations decreased by 73-78% in urban areas on the Balinese Day of Silence, while an analysis by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) saw a 33% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions on Nyepi Day.

As Darwiati said, this is just from one day and one island. “If we were to start a nationwide event, our impact would be much larger. With an event like this not only would we be giving ourselves a break and some room to breathe, we’d also be giving the environment a break from all the carbon we constantly use.”

With half of the global population on coronavirus lockdown, there’s no better time to learn from a culture where slowing down and switching off has been mandated for centuries – if only for a day at a time.

“Prior to Covid-19, Bali was the only airport in the world that would close down, for 24 hours during the Balinese New Year. This is a big move for an island that relies heavily on tourism but shows the great respect for tradition and slowing down that is so ingrained in Balinese culture,” Darwiati said. “The West can learn to honour the simple things in life – connecting with nature, connecting with family, connecting with ourselves – slowing down, switching off and looking at the stars.”

I took her advice. As soon as dusk fell, I went into the garden and gazed up at the inkiest, most star-filled sky I’d ever seen. There was no electric light or fire in sight. As Kam said, “So much has become lost due to light and noise pollution.” When Nyepi was extended for a day this year, I can’t say I was disappointed. Another day of no work, fire, entertainment or travelling didn’t seem so bad. I decided to keep my laptop closed for another 24 hours.

253,Sweden’s single-diner restaurant,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200526-swedens-single-diner-restaurant,['Lola Akinmade Åkerström'],"The romantic picture of sitting in a lush meadow surrounded by blooming wildflowers and dining from a picnic basket might conjure up thoughts of Instagram lifestyle influencers, who tend to be mostly female. But for Linda Karlsson, her novel dining idea’s main demographic has surprised her.

“Men,” she said. “It has been almost only men who have booked the table.”

“The table” she refers to is, in fact, her new restaurant Bord För En (Table For One), which opened on 10 May. Located in Ransäter, a tiny rural town tucked in the Swedish countryside in Värmland, around 350km west of Stockholm, it consists of a sole wooden table and single chair set in her garden overlooking a verdant pasture. A candle and bouquet of wildflowers finish off the demure table setting.

The food is a way of sending people to a warm and slow night in Barcelona since we’re unable to travel during these times

The story behind this new venture is as sweet as the setting. When Karlsson’s elderly parents wanted to visit her during the current Covid-19 situation, she and her partner, Rasmus Persson, needed to devise a way of sharing a meal with them without compromising their health. Since they couldn’t sit at the same table for safety reasons, they decided to set up a table outside in the garden to “remotely dine” with Karlsson’s parents while they conversed through the window.

Watching that tranquil scene as her parents dined outside lit a creative spark within both Karlsson and Persson. They realised they could invite others to enjoy this peaceful solitude while still maintaining some social distancing.

And thus, the idea of their single-diner restaurant was born.

Each evening at 19:00, their solo customer takes a seat at the table and eats alone to the sounds of rustling trees and chirping birds. There are no wait staff and no direct human contact. To deliver the food safely, a red and white gingham-frill basket is attached to a rope and served from Karlsson’s second-floor kitchen window via a pulley system fashioned using an old bicycle wheel to their guest sitting 50m away.

You may also be interested in:

• America's 'fried chicken war'

• The Swedish word poached by the world

• The dish that ended the plague

This setup not only allows them to adhere to the current recommendations from the Public Health Agency of Sweden to maintain 1-2m of space between people, but allows diners complete solitude and tranquillity.

Once the guest opens the basket, they’ll find the first of their three courses. To notify the kitchen that they are ready for their next course, they simply need to ring the bell attached to the pulley system. The menu is always the same; changes are only made if Karlsson and Persson can’t get hold of the locally produced goods they’re committed to using as part of their food philosophy.

While Karlsson’s background is in hospitality and communications, their plant-based, vegetarian-friendly three-course offering is crafted by Persson, who trained as a chef in Gothenburg, worked at high-end seafood restaurant Sjömagasinet and learned from legendary Swedish chef Leif Mannerström. Persson’s gastronomic stints also took him to Barcelona, and his cuisine is infused with Spanish-inspired elements.

The first course is råraka, Swedish-style hash browns with thick smetana sour cream, seaweed caviar and sorrel. It’s followed by “Black & Yellow”, a plating of yellow carrot-ginger puree, browned hazelnut butter, sweetcorn croquette (redolent of Spanish tapas) and serpent root (Spanish salsify) ash.

“The food is a way of sending people to a warm and slow night in Barcelona since we’re unable to travel during these times,” Karlsson said.

The dessert, called “Last Days of Summer”, is ginned blueberries with iced buttermilk and viola sugar made from their homegrown beetroots. It’s a secret recipe handed down from Persson’s grandmother, who recently passed away at 99 years old.

“Rasmus knows how to make these dishes at home, so I'm very pleased,” Karlsson said. “And since I can't cook at all, that's one reason why I married a chef.”

Drink pairings are made from non-alcoholic spirit Seedlip with seasonal ingredients such as elderflower and strawberries, and are curated by renowned bar owner Joel Söderbäck, who grew up in Ransäter and whose Stockholm-based cocktail bar Tjoget was awarded a spot on the World's 50 Best Bars in 2019.

Due to current travel restrictions worldwide, most of Bord För En's patrons so far have been locals from Ransäter and the region of Värmland, and the waitlist can range from a few people to more than a dozen depending on the day of the week. While many people have tried to make a two-person reservation, suggesting that their dining partners can sit on the grass to enforce social distancing, Karlsson notes that this defeats the purpose of the solo experience.

“It’s really about having the time to get to know yourself and to truly honour that,” Karlsson said.

She believes there’s more to her concept than just novelty. What was a call of duty to help enforce social distancing guidelines has unwittingly turned into a quiet, self-care movement. With much of the world in lockdown or quarantine, Karlsson believes people are realising they’re afraid of spending time alone, and she wants to help turn the experience into a positive one.

“Our business model is not a very lucrative one,” says Karlsson. “We only accept one guest per day just to be able to really have the opportunity to make our guests create their own space.”

It’s really about having the time to get to know yourself and to truly honour that

For Karlsson, it’s hard to put a time limit on creating that personal introspective space. It often makes her think of American poet Mary Oliver’s poem “The Summer Day” and the question it poses: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” That’s why, beyond supplying the food and the venue, she leaves the exact experience up to the guest, who is free to linger for hours over their meal, read, write, soak up nature, and fully exist in the moment without distractions. There’s no closing time or harried waiter bringing the bill.

In fact, there’s no bill at all. In lieu of payment, guests are invited to make a voluntary contribution based on what they feel the meal and experience was worth to them. Karlsson and Persson were never planning to turn profits from serving a single meal a day, and are instead donating proceeds to Ulla-Britt Henrikssons Kulturstipendium, a fund to support creative mothers set up by Persson. Named after his mother Ulla-Britt and inspired by her setting aside her own creative dreams to raise him and his siblings, the fund awards 10,000 kr (£845) on Mother’s Day, 26 May, to support a nominated mother towards realising her own artistic vision.

As for why their clientele has been mostly male? Karlsson has no idea. “I don't have the answer as to why it's been mostly men,” she said. “But our table is available to everyone.” She notes that women don’t often treat themselves out to solo dinners and maybe it’s time to consider this as one more necessary act of self-care.

Karlsson and Persson plan to keep Bord För En open until 1 August and reopen annually every spring and summer. And with lots of international interest from fellow chefs and foodie colleagues, Persson and Karlsson are now considering expanding their idea globally. They are currently inviting chefs who are interested in launching similar concepts to apply.

“Our vision is to open up more tables around the world and unite our feeling of being alone together,” said Karlsson.

258,Why First Nations communities are uninviting visitors,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200525-why-first-nations-communities-are-uninviting-visitors,['Diane Selkirk'],"The idea of Covid-19 entering the remote First Nation’s community of Bella Bella terrifies Marilyn Slett, chief councillor of the Heiltsuk Tribal Council. Located on British Columbia’s (BC) central coast, the water- and air-access only community of 1,400 is a gateway to Canada’s Great Bear Rainforest, a region the size of Ireland that’s famed for its eco-tourism opportunities.

One of 198 distinct First Nations in BC, each with its own unique traditions and history, the Heiltsuk Nation has spent years revitalising and preserving its culture. The long process reached a milestone with the November 2019 opening of the community’s first Big House (where the Heiltsuk gathered for sacred communal events) to be built in 200 years, and more plans are in the future. But, as it does in many Indigenous communities, the future takes its cues from the past. And Covid-19, which is particularly dangerous to older people, therefore puts the community’s future at risk.

“Our laws and traditions are oral,” said Slett. “They’re passed down by our Knowledge Keepers,” a group of Elders who have learned the Nation’s customs, traditions and protocols. “We only have 30 fluent Hailhzaqvla-speaking Elders left,” she added. “We’ll uphold Heiltsuk laws and do everything we can to protect them.”

Slett is referring to the emergency measures her community has put in place. Like many Indigenous communities in coastal BC, and around the world, the Heiltsuk Nation has enacted a strict lockdown, opting to go well beyond the provincial guidelines by banning all non-essential travel in or out of their territory.

We only have 30 fluent Hailhzaqvla-speaking Elders left

On the roads and in the public ferry terminals leading into the normally tourist-friendly communities on BC’s coast, checkpoints have been set up, manned by Guardian Watchmen who typically act as friendly ambassadors and cultural interpreters. Out on the water, these Guardians are using AIS (Automatic Identification System) to identify, track and intercept any boat that arrives in their waters. Their role is to ensure the vessel should be there and turn it back if it’s not. Shifted to a new frontline, these traditional protectors, stewards and guardians of First Nations lands and waters have begun rediscovering the power of protecting a Nation’s greatest treasure: its people.

Canada’s Indigenous people have always been stewards of their land and culture – but what’s changed is how they now combine Western science and law with cultural knowledge and traditional laws to secure their survival. Often, the weight of this combination is directed towards things like sovereignty claims; archaeology has been used to secure land claims. But now communities, who cherish their Elders for the guidance they provide, are listening to international health guidelines and then combining that knowledge with their own values in the way that protects the community best.

It’s not difficult to understand why the Heiltsuk have opted to manage the pandemic by following the advice of their own leaders and shutting off their community to outsiders. For 14,000 years, they have lived in balance within a territory that spans about 15,540 sq km and extends through the Great Bear Rainforest. Heiltsuk historians estimate that at their cultural peak, as many as 20,000 people lived in 50 summer and winter villages set in ancient forests of huge Sitka spruce, red cedar, western hemlock and Douglas fir.

European contact, dating from the 1780s, brought devastation. “We survived smallpox, we survived measles, we survived government policy,” Slett said. But the onslaught took its toll. In the 1880s, the remnants of the severely depleted Heiltsuk communities gathered into one village near Bella Bella: their population had been diminished to around 200 people.

And then the 1918 flu came. “My mom told me about my grandmother who remembered the ladies crying and talking about all of the losses. There were whole households passing away – and no time for proper burials,” said Slett.

Cultural devastation wasn’t unique to the Heiltsuk. In many Indigenous tourism offerings in Canada, that painful and turbulent journey is something visitors learn about. “Our most effective businesses are built around sharing culture and cultural revitalisation,” said Keith Henry, president and CEO of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada.

Since time immemorial, Guardians have had a role in managing land and water and in exerting rights

More than opportunities to see wildlife, hear songs or learn how people create art or survive off the land; modern Indigenous tourism in Canada is a $1.8bn industry that combines experiences with culture in a way that celebrates the warmth, humour and resilience of Indigenous people.

“It’s not Disney-fying us, it’s not making us like a petting zoo; it’s really just sharing who we are,” said Henry.

Located 55km north of Bella Bella, the Kitasoo / Xai'xais Nations village of Klemtu is also on lockdown. Chief councillor Roxanne Robinson says the decision to close the community to outsiders was an obvious one, as “protecting the health and safety of people is the work of a leader”.

The rugged landscape and wildlife, which includes whales, coastal wolves, black bears, grizzly bears and the spirit bear, attracts visitors from all over the world and makes up a vital part of the local economy. Robinson says that closing their community in mid-March was a hard choice, but it was just in time. Just south, Heiltsuk Watchmen on the water reported they started turning back yachts. American and Canadian boaters trying to flee big cities and those who wanted to hunt or fish (which is considered essential in BC, but not by the coastal communities) had started heading for more remote, Covid-19­-free communities.

In normal times, these Guardian Watchmen would ensure people knew to stay away from sacred sites and to follow wildlife regulations.

A global concern Inadequate healthcare and higher rates of chronic health conditions means indigenous communities around the world are at greater risk from Covid-19. Argentina: Home to at least 35 officially recognised indigenous communities, some have opted to insulate themselves from outsiders.

Australia: Some remote indigenous communities locked themselves down early. They were quickly supported by the federal government, which is using its Biosecurity Act to limit access to essential staff and services.

Brazil: With 850,000 indigenous people, different groups are responding with strict isolation; guarding their communities from outsiders and using traditional treatments.

Kenya: Maasai people have traditionally survived pandemics by isolating deeper into their territory. During Covid-19, many people are currently scattered and isolated.

US: The Navajo Nation is one of the epicentres of the virus in the US and currently has the highest infection rates in the country.

“They are an extension of nationhood,” said Claire Hutton, Indigenous Stewardship Director at conservation organisation Nature United. “Since time immemorial, Guardians have had a role in managing land and water and in exerting rights.”

In earlier Kitasoo / Xai'xais villages, Robinson said, there was always one Guardian Watchman situated outside the village to watch for strangers. While in the Heiltsuk culture, the Guardian Watchmen were informal custodians of the land and water, following traditional laws to protect food sources and conserve the landscape.

While the ancient tradition faded with colonisation, modern Guardian Watchmen programmes came into being in the 1980s with programmes in Haida Gwaii, 200km west of Bella Bella, and in the Innu territories in Labrador. Today more than 50 different programmes in Nations across Canada fulfil a wide variety of different roles, depending on what a community may need.

Hutton, who coordinates a team that provides technical support to Guardians across Canada, says the programmes are as distinct as the Nations themselves, but there are common themes and issues. Many are focused on stewardship and ensuring the protection of traditional food sources. Some have a strong science focus, and Guardians are critical for data collection and monitoring biodiversity or species at risk. Other programmes concentrate on tourism and the Guardians act as interpreters.

The goal of Nature United is to support the Guardians with resources that match their requirements. But manning checkpoints to prevent the spread of Covid-19 has brought up an unexpected set of needs. “Offering conflict training and Tactical Communications webinars is new,” Hutton said.

As the Guardian Watchmen shift from scientific data gathering and land preservation to guarding the frontlines, they’ve encountered pushback from travellers who question their authority. While British Columbia’s Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation agree that First Nations have the authority to restrict travel into their communities, at the same time the province, like many places, has begun reopening, forcing Indigenous communities to protect themselves.

Slett says while it would be better if Canada and BC reinforced Indigenous restrictions, the communities have the knowledge they need and are ready to safeguard themselves.

Following traditional laws, which focus on balancing the needs of the people, the environment and the economy, coastal Nations, which battled each other in ancient times, have come together. In an effort to keep out outsiders, Haida Gwaii and the Central and North Coast, including the Heiltsuk and Kitasoo / Xai'xais Nations, have set up a coalition. They are working collectively to let visitors know that while they are valued and wanted, now is not the time to visit. The communities are simply too vulnerable to risk any loss.

We are self-isolating at this time so that when we gather again, nobody is left behind

“We know that this isn’t over and it’s going to be a few years before there’s a vaccination and it’s no longer a threat to humankind,” Slett said. “Indigenous communities cannot be left on the sidelines and on the fringes of what’s going on. We need to work together as we uphold our measures.”

Meanwhile the Heiltsuk – and other locked-down communities that have closed their borders ­– have turned inward. “We have Guardian Watchmen that are out there daily. We also have a patrol that monitors the entry points of the community,” said Slett. “And we’re turning to our Knowledge Keepers to see what we can do in terms of adapting during this period.”

What the Knowledge Keepers are teaching is the value of self-sufficiency. All along the coast, communities are relying more heavily on traditional marine foods like eulachon oil, smoked salmon, fresh herring eggs and roasted seaweed. Community gardens are being started and leaders are encouraging people to find strength in the power of looking after themselves.

“If you look through our histories, I can’t imagine our ancestors or our leadership of 30, 40, 50, 100 years ago having the kind of confidence to determine our future this directly,” said Henry. While the financial implications of shutting down tourism will hurt communities, he added, the whole point of tourism all along has been to strengthen the culture: Nations making their own decisions does that.

Slett said that they want tourists, they want visitors, but later. Right now, they need to get everyone through the pandemic safely: “One of our staff members posted this on Facebook: “We are self-isolating at this time so that when we gather again, nobody is left behind.”

262,Victory gardens: A war-time hobby that’s back in fashion,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200524-victory-gardens-a-war-time-hobby-thats-back-in-fashion,['Ellie Howard'],"It was late March when the UK lockdown was first announced. Around the same time, I ordered a seedling tray and two packets of “Cut ‘n’ Come Again” leafy greens: arugula, rucola, oriental mustard, pak choy and borecole. Nearly two months later, lockdown still hasn’t been lifted, but my tufty lettuce leaves have shot up. For billions, globally, the Covid-19 pandemic has spelt a period of deep uncertainty and stagnation, but watching green miracles occur in my vegetable patch has been reassuring. I’m not alone in thinking so.

The early weeks of the pandemic threw the global supply chain into disarray, setting off a wave of stockpiling. The US saw a spike in alternative milk sales, Australia lacked flour on supermarket shelves, pasta was scarce in Italy and eggs in Britain. Many countries reported fears of labour shortages for perishables such as fresh vegetables, according to Time magazine. As with any crisis, people have been quick to take matters into their own hands – as highlighted by soaring seed sales.

• A British feast from garden weeds

• The dish that ended the plague

• A dish born from the bomb

A recent report by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows 42% of Britons have taken to gardening to cope with lockdown, while a third of a million searched for tips on growing garden variety crops on the Royal Horticultural Society website – the most popular being the humble potato. Across the UK and beyond, people are digging in their backyards, potting plants on balconies or using windowsills as suntraps for seedlings.

The rush to grow-your-own has sparked comparisons to ‘victory gardening’. Dug either side of the Atlantic, from North America to Great Britain and further afield in Australia, these kitchen gardens became popularised in World War One and World War Two when shortages reached critical levels in the Allied nations. In response, governments coordinated domestic campaigns calling upon citizens to fuel the war effort and feed the country. Working the soil became a patriotic duty.

In the UK, most widely remembered is the “Dig for Victory” campaign launched by the British Ministry of Agriculture in 1939. It was so successful that the number of allotments grew to 1.7 million in just three years, while private gardens with vegetable produce numbered five million.

Food prices are going up, and fresh produce is going to be at a premium

During the same period, a horticultural magazine paraphrased Napoleon’s claim that the English were a nation of shopkeepers, instead writing: “We might with equal justice be called a nation of gardeners”. The claim stuck. Our obsession with gardening stretches far beyond a national pastime; it is rooted in the British psyche. The garden is considered a private sanctuary but also a site of creative expression and personal pride, as reflected in the highly competitive British annual “giant vegetable” competitions that spring up from Harrogate to Carmarthenshire. For Britons, growing our own produce has the added value of bringing locals together.

Victory gardens were also not just about food: cultivating fruit and vegetables boosted morale and built momentum. Growing for the greater good banded together communities and enabled those stuck at home to play a part, however small. Perhaps this is why the gardens’ legacy can still be felt today. While using the analogy of war to describe a viral pandemic is controversial, it makes sense that we‘ve connected the two moments in time. It is the sense of community spirit we want to revive – and a victory garden quite literally says we are in this together.

Beyond caring for our own families, green-fingered types are sharing produce with their neighbours. A survey commissioned by the British charity RSA cited that 42% of respondents feel the outbreak has made them value food more, and 10% have shared supplies for the first time.

I first noticed the neighbourly potential of plants three weeks after lockdown had begun, when a neighbour I hardly knew knocked on the door of my house in Suffolk. When I answered, she leapt behind the gate: “Alpine strawberries,” she yelled, “Plant them in partial shade”. A week later, a trio of pepper seedlings appeared – another gift. To say thank you, I delivered fat garlicky leaves of wild ransom, foraged between bluebells in a nearby woodland. Now, we swap excited texts about her egg-laying tortoise, Rosie. Since then, I check what Jeanie and her husband, John, would like from the shops; why I waited for a pandemic to do this is beyond me.

Outside their gate, a sign offers willowherb and more wild strawberries – anything surplus they don’t need. “If someone likes something in your garden, you can just take a cutting for them,” John said. “It doesn’t cost you anything.”

The Bristol Seed Swap has been promoting the circular economy of seed saving for years. A few days after lockdown, they advertised leftover seed packets from a previous event, which the public could request free of charge by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope. Diane Holness, a spokesperson for the non-profit, said swells of gardeners were in touch with requests. “We sent seeds to around 150 people,” she said. “I think everyone is aware that food prices are going up, and that fresh produce is going to be at a premium.”

The most requested seeds were tomato; adaptable and easy to grow. “I think they are one crop that can fit into even the tiniest space, even a balcony,” she said.

Luckily, the organisation had plenty. As Holness said, harvesting seeds costs you nothing, but goes a long way to helping someone else: “If you know how, you could almost save enough cabbage seeds for everyone in the city.”

Two hours west of Bristol, West Dorset’s foodie capital, Bridport, has been a hive of activity since lockdown. Created in response to quarantine, the Bridport Grow Your Own community Facebook group has played a large role in greening the town. Just as the 1930s Dig for Victory leaflets relayed growing information, online groups are helping new growers by circulating plant wisdom.

“As a town, I think we are all at it,” environmentalist and educator Kim Squirrel told me. “People have dug up their gardens and others are growing in pots.” She works a private allotment on the town’s edge, shared between 10 houses, that includes her neighbour Rachel Millson. Both have turned their full attention to growing with news of the lockdown. Squirrel’s potager garden is crammed with brassicas alongside beans, French to dwarf, winding up bamboo stalks that are also home-grown. Pear and espalier apple trees will fruit come the summer.

Millson’s garden exploits are equally impressive: overwintering crops such as earthy beetroot, onion and leeks fill up one plot. Another bed is an experiment in perennial vegetables, such as asparagus, that take less carbon from the soil.

“The pandemic has cemented in my mind the need to be growing more food, not just for my own family and to save money, but for the wider community,” Millson said.

She feels fortunate to have an allotment, but wishes there was more recognition that growing your own food isn’t just a pastime but “real, important work”. Millson strongly believes it has personal benefits and also aids community wellbeing. Pre-empting that food inequality is going to be at an all-time high, she has purposefully grown extra vegetable crops with a mind to donate them to a local foodbank.

Part of the fun of growing your own produce is in sharing your hard-earned bounty with family and friends. But while delivering your overzealous courgette crop is practical, there is something special in giving someone a plant they can cultivate themselves.

We have common ground now, something other than the fear around the pandemic

Bruno White had just moved to Ditcheat, Somerset, when the UK went into lockdown on 23 March. He wrote to his new neighbours to introduce himself and set up an informal mutual aid group. One elderly gentleman he shopped for was so grateful that he left a collection of plants on White’s doorstep, each with handwritten instructions. Shortly afterwards, another thankful neighbour gifted him packets of biodynamic seeds: “He taught us about Three Sisters. It's a traditional Native American method. You grow corn, then beans to climb up it, then squash to shade and stifle any weeds.”

White has since been cultivating his garden and has been surprised at how easy it is – and how kind his neighbours are. “We have common ground now, something other than the fear around the pandemic,” he said.

While the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic were filled with panic, hopefully it will be the incredible displays of neighbourly spirit that we will remember. The victory garden movement of the World Wars not only helped strengthen communities, but also gave home-bound individuals a chance to contribute to those fighting on the front line. Amid a pandemic, the vegetable garden has similar appeal: it offers a sustainable solution to food security that not only helps us, but allows us to care for our neighbours too.

At a time of uncertainty and confusion, even planting a lettuce seed can offer a semblance of hope.

267,A mysterious US desert civilisation,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200521-a-mysterious-us-desert-civilisation,['Smoke'],"In the heart of the San Juan Basin, in the arid north-western corner of New Mexico, stands one of the greatest ancient treasures in the US: the remarkably preserved remains of a vast building complex believed to have been constructed between 850 and 1250AD that may have housed as many as 5,000 people. The high desert area of Chaco Canyon sees cold winters, scorching-hot summers and only about 22cm of rainfall every year. Yet, it was home to a thriving, yet mysterious, civilisation – the Chacoans, ancestors of the Puebloans.

In 1907, this isolated 53sq-mile expanse of desert became a national historical park, containing 13 major ruins and more than 400 archaeological sites. Pueblo Bonito, the largest excavated site, covers about 2 acres and has roughly 800 rooms arranged in a D-shaped building. The site was designed with sophisticated irrigation systems, the doorways are perfectly aligned with each other to facilitate communication and researchers estimate it housed about 2,000 people.

This media cannot be played on your device.

Today, visitors can wander around the same maze of chambers and roads used by its residents roughly 1,000 years ago. Some of the structures used to create the roofs and different floors are long gone, but their remains clearly reveal how they were built. Approximately 200,000 wooden pillars were used in the construction and were most likely hand-carried from the Chuska Mountains and Mount Taylor, more than 112km away.

The Chacoan roads are another impressive feature of the complex. There are about 650km of them, some 9m wide, built mostly in straight lines that cut through the rough topography instead of going around it. Their positioning, starting at a central structure and running towards notable natural elements, such as lakes and mountains, suggests they represented symbolic connections between man and nature. Yet, it doesn’t mean they weren’t practical: studies have shown that walking on those roads is less tiresome than walking on the rough terrain next to them.

Over the years, archaeologists have come up with different theories for why Chaco was built. Although the place seems to have been a trade hub, the buildings suggest it may also have been an important ceremonial site and point to the Chacoans’ impressive astronomical knowledge. The walls are aligned with the axis of the sunrise on an equinox and the north doorway faces almost exactly true north. Contemporary New Mexico Pueblo tribes, such as the Zuni, still consider Chaco Canyon a sacred site and they return there for ceremonies.

Since 1987, the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, along with other smaller Chaco sites, is a Unesco World Heritage site. For the past few years, one of the biggest threats to the site has been the oil and gas drilling and mining around Chaco Canyon. In 2019, the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act was introduced to the US Senate – if it passes, it will ban those activities within a 16km radius of the site.

273,Riz au lait: A simple French dish made from pantry staples,https://bbc.com/travel/story/20200520-rice-pudding-a-simple-french-dish-made-from-pantry-staples,['Emily Monaco'],"Almost the moment that lockdown was announced in France, chefs started posting recipes for French comfort food desserts on Instagram, hoping to spread a bit of sweetness among their fellow citizens. But while crepes, yogurt cake and madeleines all certainly emerged, the recipe to feature most frequently, from the feed of Michelin-starred Stéphanie le Quellec to those of renowned pastry chefs Christophe Michalak and Yann Couvreur, was the humble riz au lait (rice pudding) – a custard-like dessert made by slowly cooking rice with milk and sugar.

A global comfort food While rice pudding exists in various forms around the globe, its very first apparition is hazy: some attribute it to China, while others point to the Indian subcontinent. East Asian iterations include simple sweet congee or the aptly named “eight treasures” steamed pudding, flavoured with a variety of fruits and sweet bean paste. In India, meanwhile, kheer has been enjoyed since ancient times, associated with Hindu god Shiva and with Ayurvedic therapies. Today, nearly every culture around the world has its own version: baked or boiled, spiced or sweetened with fruit. Latin American arroz con leche is often made with condensed milk and spices; in Indonesia, black glutinous rice is the base for bubur ketan hitan. In Scandinavia, tradition even demands that a bowl be left out for mischief-making Christmas elves.

“It’s really a childhood dessert in French culture,” said Marine Gora, co-founder of Gramme restaurant in Paris. “I’d say everyone probably has a childhood memory associated with riz au lait.”

According to culinary historian Patrick Rambourg, riz au lait has long featured on French tables – if not specifically as a comfort food dessert, or even a dessert at all. While riz au lait recipes date as far back as the 14th Century, the concoction, then often made with broth (or almond milk on lean days when the Catholic Church forbade meat and dairy), was usually served to the bedridden or ailing thanks to its nourishing qualities and digestibility. But above all, riz au lait was generally a dish served to the aristocracy.

“Rice was still rare, at that time,” said Rambourg. “Very rare. And so, it was mainly eaten by the rich.”

It was probably because of this association with the upper crust that riz au lait soon took on a sweeter profile, seasoned with saffron and sugar – both of which were rare and expensive, at the time.

By the 16th Century, however, rice began to become more common in France – and in Europe in general – and riz au lait thus started to appear on more modest tables, notably among peasants in the French countryside, albeit only for holiday meals. When beet sugar became popular in France in the 19th Century, thereby making it a more commonplace sweetener even on modest tables, riz au lait slowly but surely became something that those from all walks of life could enjoy, from a simple dessert sweetened only with sugar to more elaborate riz à l’impératrice with candied fruits and alcohol.

The idea of riz au lait being a childhood dessert, then, is one that appeared “very recently,” Rambourg said. As for how exactly that came to be, the waters are murky. Perhaps it comes from the familiarity of its ingredients; perhaps from its digestibility, or the pureness of its white colour, or just from its ease.

But for Rambourg, there’s not one simple answer.

“I think there’s something else behind it… something that isn’t always easy to explain,” he said. “There are recipes that evoke feelings far more than flavour, perhaps.”

While riz au lait is firmly ensconced in the nostalgic, comfort food category of “recettes de grand-mère” (literally, “grandmother’s recipes”), in many French families today, riz au lait is more often eaten out of a store-bought plastic pot than served out of a fancy copper saucepan.

“Often, it’s pretty poorly made,” said Gora. “It’s not creamy, it’s kind of overly compact.”

Some homemade recipes up the ante by folding in whipped cream or egg yolks for richness, while others spice it up with vanilla, cinnamon or caramel. When professional chefs put their hand to the dish, however, it is often to add contemporary textural contrast. Gora’s version calls for caramel-coated puffed rice atop the creamy pudding.

“Whenever you’re building a dish, you always try to look for different textures, so a bit of crunch,” said Gora. “It came to me naturally: the crispy, caramelised rice with a touch of caramel.”

Her recipe is unsurprisingly quite popular among her clients. And while it’s not on her regular menu, patrons make frequent requests for its appearance.

“Whenever anyone asks for it, I always make it the next day!” she said.

Chef Stéphane Jégo, too, opted to include a crunchy caramel topping when he created a version at his 7th-arrondissement Paris restaurant Chez L’Ami Jean 16 years ago. To hear Jégo tell it, he never intended for the riz au lait to remain on the menu quite so long. He was just looking for a nostalgic dessert he could serve that was easy to prepare in advance.

“I wanted something that hearkened back to childhood,” he said, “and to this idea of communal dining.”

His riz au lait has three components: the pudding itself; a creamy caramel made with salted Brittany butter; and house-made nougatine with nuts enrobed in a crunchy caramel coating (see recipe below). Served by the generous bowlful with a wooden spoon, it quickly became the star of Jégo’s menu.

“There’s this regressive side to it, where you get to the end of the meal, and the riz au lait comes, and the first thing everyone says is, ‘Oh, it’s way too much!’,” Jégo said, laughing. “And then it’s just like… oh, one spoon, two spoons, three spoons… and all of a sudden, the bowl is empty.”

Now, Jégo said, he couldn’t take it off the menu, even if he wanted to. “It’s crazy: I get stopped in the street, even abroad, for riz au lait.

“That, to me, is worth all the stars in the world. Because it means you’ve touched people. You’ve got to the heart of what good food can bring to people, and to pleasure, and to memory,” he said.

During confinement, Jégo has prepared 200 litres of riz au lait for hungry Parisians to take away and enjoy at home.

“I don’t really think mine is any better than anyone else’s. It’s the orchestration. The generosity. You’ve got this childlike zeal that just… takes over,” he said, as he stirred the caramel for his most recent batch.

“People just need that comfort.”

Stéphane Jégo’s Riz au Lait Recipe



Rice Pudding

2.5l milk

1 vanilla bean, split

500g short-grain rice

500g sugar

1l cream (Jégo uses Normandy cream)

Heat the milk and the vanilla bean. Add the rice and cook 40 minutes over low heat. When the rice is tender enough to crush between your fingers, add the sugar, and cook 15 minutes more. Remove the vanilla bean and chill the pudding in the fridge.

Whip the cream to medium peaks. Remove the rice from the fridge and use a spoon to break it up and loosen it. Fold in the whipped cream.

Nougatine

250g pistachios

250g walnuts

250g almonds (toasted in the oven with 3 dabs of butter)

125g unsalted butter

190g turbinado sugar

In a saucepan over medium heat, make a light brown caramel with the butter and the sugar. Add the walnuts and the pistachios, and then toss them in the caramel until well coated. Pour everything onto a lined baking sheet containing the toasted almonds, and then set aside to cool.

Salted Caramel

600g heavy cream, plus 25ml for whipping

125g salted butter (Jégo uses Brittany butter)

600g sugar

37g flaky sea salt (Jégo uses fleur de sel)

5½ gelatine sheets, 2g each

In a saucepan over medium heat, make a dark brown caramel with the sugar and the butter. Off the heat, add the cream, sea salt flakes and gelatine. Cook for 30 minutes over low heat. Set aside in the fridge.

Whip the cream to stiff peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into the caramel.

When the nougatine has cooled, break it up into bite-sized pieces. Serve the pudding, caramel and nougatine in serving bowls, so that each diner can assemble his or her own portion.

But above all, riz au lait was generally a dish served to the aristocracy.
The idea of riz au lait being a childhood dessert, then, is one that appeared “very recently,” Rambourg said.

It’s an unfathomable figure, but one that Gerald Larrouy-Maumus mentions often. It is the potential toll facing the world as disease-causing microbes develop resistance to our best defence against them – antibiotics.

Currently, 700,000 people die each year of drug-resistant diseases. Over the past decade or so, the list of medicines we can use against harmful bacteria has been dwindling. At the same time, other disease-causing organisms – fungi, viruses and parasites – are also developing resistance to the drugs we use to tackle them almost as quickly as we can make new ones. It means the illnesses they cause are getting harder to treat.

As Larrouy-Maumus, an infectious disease researcher at Imperial College London in the UK, warns, “If we do nothing, 10 million people per year will die.”

He is among those looking for new ways to tackle antimicrobial resistance. His plan is to turn the very surfaces that many of these pathogens use to spread from person to person into weapons against them.

Some bacteria – including E. Coli and MRSA – can survive for several months on inanimate surfaces, while infectious yeasts can last for weeks.

283,The secret to a long and healthy life? Eat less,https://bbc.com/future/article/20170601-the-secret-to-a-long-and-healthy-life-eat-less,['Alex Riley'],"Eating less certainly seemed to help the monkeys, but calorie restriction is much tougher for people out in the real world. For one, our access to regular, high-calorie meals is now easier than ever; with companies like Deliveroo and UberEats, there is no longer a need to walk to the restaurant anymore. And two, gaining weight simply comes more naturally to some people.

“There’s a huge genetic component to all of this and its much harder work for some people than it is for others to stay trim,” says Anderson. “We all know someone who can eat an entire cake and nothing happens, they look the exact same. And then someone else walks past a table with a cake on it and they have to go up a pant size.”

Ideally, the amount and types of food we eat should be tailored to who we are – our genetic predisposition to gaining weight, how we metabolise sugars, how we store fat, and other physiological fluxes that are beyond the scope of scientific instruction at the moment, and perhaps forever.

But a predisposition to obesity can be used as a guide to life choices rather than an inevitability. “I personally have a genetic history of obesity running through my family, and I practice a flexible form of caloric restriction,” says Susan Roberts a dietary scientist at Tufts University in Boston. “I keep my BMI at 22, and [have calculated] that that requires eating 80% of what I would eat if my BMI was at 30 like every other member of my family.” Roberts stresses that it isn’t hard – she follows her own weight management programme using a tool called iDiet to help her eat less but avoid feeling hungry or deprived of enjoyment. If this wasn’t possible, she adds, she wouldn’t practise calorie restriction.

Not only has Roberts seen the problems of obesity first-hand in her family, she knows the benefits of CR better than most. For over 10 years she has been a leading scientist in the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy trial, also known as Calerie. Over two years, 218 healthy men and women aged between 21 and 50 years were split into two groups. In one, people were allowed to eat as they normally would (ad libitum), while the other ate 25% less (CR). Both had health checks every six months.

Unlike in the Rhesus monkey trials, tests over two years can’t determine whether CR reduces or delays age-related diseases. There simply isn’t enough time for their development. But the Calerie trials tested for the next best thing: the early biological signs of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.

Published in 2015, the results after two years were very positive. In the blood of calorie-restricted people, the ratio of “good” cholesterol to “bad” cholesterol had increased, molecules associated with tumour formation – called tumour necrosis factors (TNFs) – were reduced by around 25%, and levels of insulin resistance, a sure sign of diabetes, fell by nearly 40% compared to people who ate their normal diets. Overall, the blood’s pressure was lower.","And two, gaining weight simply comes more naturally to some people.

Two-year-old Emile Ouamouno had been fond of playing inside the tree, which was near his home in Meliandou – a village in the heart of the Guinean jungle. But other life had also discovered its cosy confines: bats. Children would sometimes catch them there, before roasting them for dinner.

Then Emile got sick. On the 28 December 2013, he succumbed to a violent and mysterious illness. His mother, sister and grandmother were next. And that was it – after the funeral, the disease gradually began to spread.

By 23 March 2014, there had been 49 cases and 29 deaths – and scientists confirmed that it was Ebola. Over the next three and a half years, the world looked on in horror as the virus claimed more than 11,325 lives. But while this was going on, another tragedy was unfolding.

The outbreak severely strained the resources of local healthcare services – workers died, large numbers of hospitals closed and those that remained open were overwhelmed with tackling Ebola itself. In the three most affected countries – Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea – people began avoiding healthcare at all costs. They were afraid of this mysterious new disease, but they were also fearful of doctors. With their sinister white protective overalls and association with sudden death, healthcare workers had become heavily stigmatised. People didn’t want to go near them.

As a result, a 2017 analysis found that the pandemic led to a dramatic drop in the popularity of medical care. The number of pregnant women seeking help with childbirth was down by 80%, vaccination rates plummeted and there were 40% fewer admissions of children with malaria. Ironically, after an intense international effort to combat the pandemic, this collateral damage was more severe than the disease itself.","By 23 March 2014, there had been 49 cases and 29 deaths – and scientists confirmed that it was Ebola.

Two-year-old Emile Ouamouno had been fond of playing inside the tree, which was near his home in Meliandou – a village in the heart of the Guinean jungle. But other life had also discovered its cosy confines: bats. Children would sometimes catch them there, before roasting them for dinner.

Then Emile got sick. On the 28 December 2013, he succumbed to a violent and mysterious illness. His mother, sister and grandmother were next. And that was it – after the funeral, the disease gradually began to spread.

By 23 March 2014, there had been 49 cases and 29 deaths – and scientists confirmed that it was Ebola. Over the next three and a half years, the world looked on in horror as the virus claimed more than 11,325 lives. But while this was going on, another tragedy was unfolding.

The outbreak severely strained the resources of local healthcare services – workers died, large numbers of hospitals closed and those that remained open were overwhelmed with tackling Ebola itself. In the three most affected countries – Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea – people began avoiding healthcare at all costs. They were afraid of this mysterious new disease, but they were also fearful of doctors. With their sinister white protective overalls and association with sudden death, healthcare workers had become heavily stigmatised. People didn’t want to go near them.

As a result, a 2017 analysis found that the pandemic led to a dramatic drop in the popularity of medical care. The number of pregnant women seeking help with childbirth was down by 80%, vaccination rates plummeted and there were 40% fewer admissions of children with malaria. Ironically, after an intense international effort to combat the pandemic, this collateral damage was more severe than the disease itself.","By 23 March 2014, there had been 49 cases and 29 deaths – and scientists confirmed that it was Ebola.

The places themselves did not change – but from wearing masks to avoiding crowds, the way we are allowed to navigate them is going to be radically different.

Many of these changes may remain for some time. Even once the spread of coronavirus is contained, the risk of a new wave of contagion will remain as long as a vaccine is not available, which may take between nine months and two years. Moreover, scientists say, new, equally destructive diseases could paralyse humanity in the future, just as the coronavirus has done in 2020.

For those who work on planning our future cities and public spaces, the pandemic is both a daunting threat requiring immediate measures – and an opportunity to rethink how we live, move, and get together.

292,What we can learn from conspiracy theories,https://bbc.com/future/article/20200522-what-we-can-learn-from-conspiracy-theories,['Zaria Gorvett'],"In 331 BC, something was wrong with Rome. Across the city, swathes of eminent men were succumbing to sickness, and practically all of them were dying. The losses were as baffling as they were alarming.

Then one day, a slave approached a curule aedile – a kind of magistrate – and hinted that she might know why. The girl led a team of investigators to various houses, where she claimed they would find an alliance of upper-class women secretly preparing poisons. They did.

The accused were dragged to the central square, and asked to prove their innocence. Since they claimed their concoctions were medicinal, would they drink them?

Alas, two of the suspects obliged – and promptly dropped dead. Mass arrests followed, and a further 170 women were found to be involved. The incident was a huge scandal. In the aftermath, the people of Rome elected a dedicated official to perform a ritual banishment of evil, a tactic which had previously only been used as a last resort after extreme civil unrest.

Or, at least, this is the version of events that was dutifully recorded by the respected historian Livy, who was born a few hundred years later. But he wasn’t convinced that the women were really responsible, and neither are modern-day experts. Instead, Livy pointed to a far more rational explanation: an epidemic.

At the time, the city was in the grip of an unknown plague – a common cause of death in the classical world. Mass poisonings, on the other hand, were unheard of. The case discussed by Livy was the first of its kind, and the whole affair had struck Roman citizens as distinctly odd.

In fact, the women probably really were preparing medicines – and the rest of the story was heavily embellished or entirely made up. The infamous poisonings of 331 BC are thought to be a conspiracy theory, to explain deaths that had an obvious cause all along.

Amid the current pandemic, this scenario is oddly familiar. Since the beginning of April, at least 77 phone masts and 40 engineers have been attacked in the UK, after some people bought into the erroneous idea that Covid-19 is somehow being spread by powerful forces in the global telecommunications industry. Now the rumour has spread to the US, where there are fears it may lead to further violence. Yet again, reason is being cast aside, in favour of a niche explanation that involves a convoluted secret plot. (Find out why 5G is not responsible for transmitting Covid-19.)

295,Why time seems to be going faster while we are in lockdown,https://bbc.com/future/article/20200520-why-lockdown-life-feels-like-its-going-faster,['Claudia Hammond'],"As parts of the world begin to ease their lockdowns, some people are looking back and finding the time in isolation seems to have gone surprisingly fast. That’s not what many of us expected when we were first told that our lives were about to become so much more restricted than usual, with weeks of potential boredom, confined within our homes stretching ahead of us.

It’s too early for research on this of course, but anecdotally some people are puzzled to find that their days have slipped past surprisingly quickly. It seems hard to believe that we are already nearing the end of May, some two months after lockdowns began.

In the UK, people have been standing on their doorsteps every Thursday evening during the Covid-19 outbreak to applaud health workers. To me it feels as though the ritual is coming around more frequently, which is nice in one way because it is an opportunity to say hello to the neighbours, but disconcerting nonetheless because the weeks feels as though they are flashing by. Journalists from the US to Poland have also been contacting me to ask why time seems to have sped up during the crisis, so it seems I’m not alone.

One reason is that we create our own subjective experience of time in our minds and it doesn’t always match up with what we read on the clock or the calendar. A 20-minute lunch with a friend goes by in a flash, while a 20-minute wait for a delayed train can feel interminable, yet in reality of course the duration is identical.

You might also like:

We estimate time passing in two ways: prospectively (how fast is time passing right now?) and retrospectively (how fast did last week or the last decade go by?).

During lockdown, those isolated from friends, family and work have had long days to fill. People have found all sorts of inventive ways to pass the time – baking bread, planting seeds, creating video call quizzes – but inevitably when you spend every day and every evening at home, the days begin to feel a little similar. Some people have found they haven’t even been distinguishing between weekdays and weekends. (Read more about how lockdown has redefined our weekends.)

This blurring of identical days leads us to create fewer new memories, which is crucial to our sense of time perception. Memories are one of the ways that we judge how much time has passed. When you go on holiday for a week to a new place, the time goes fast while you’re away because everything is new, but when you get home, you look back and have made so many new memories that it often feels as though you’ve been away for far longer than a week.","As parts of the world begin to ease their lockdowns, some people are looking back and finding the time in isolation seems to have gone surprisingly fast.

298,How staying indoors affects your immune system,https://bbc.com/future/article/20200521-can-staying-inside-weaken-the-immune-system,['Linda Geddes'],"For the past two months, a sizable chunk of the world’s population has been shuttered inside their homes, only stepping out for essential supplies. Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.

Humans evolved on a planet with a 24-hour cycle of light and dark, and our bodies are set up to work in partnership with sunlight. One of the most obvious examples of this is the production of vitamin D in the skin in response to UVB exposure. This daily dose of vitamin D can help to strengthen our bones and teeth, but it also has an effect on our immune cells.

Vitamin D enables the macrophages in our lungs – a first line of defence against respiratory infections – to spew out an antimicrobial peptide called cathelicidin, killing bacteria and viruses directly. It also tweaks the activity of other immune cells, such as B and T cells, which orchestrate longer-term responses. People with low levels of vitamin D are at greater risk of viral respiratory tract infections such as influenza.

Researchers are now investigating whether vitamin D supplements could even reduce the risk of some of the severe complications associated with Covid-19. Earlier this month, Rose Kenny, a gerontologist at Trinity College Dublin, and her colleagues published data suggesting that European populations with the highest death rates from Covid-19, including Spain and Italy, have the lowest levels of vitamin D. This may sound counterintuitive, given their sunny climates, but it is thought that changes in lifestyle have led people to spend more time indoors, which combined with greater use of sunscreen in these countries, may be responsible for the lower levels of vitamin D.","Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.
